dear dr. abul-ela:
 
diagnoses:
1.  adenocarcinoma of the right upper lung, diagnosis in august 2016.  mr. shepherd presented 
in june 2016 with cough.  cat scan of the chest on august 18, 2016 revealed a 6.3 x 6.1 x 9.9 
cm right upper lobe mass with obstruction and direct invasion into the right hilum.  there was 
moderate right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy.  there were noncalcified nodules in the right 
middle lobe, left lingula and left lower lobe.  there is a left renal mass measuring 4.5 cm.  on 
august 31, 2016, ct-guided needle biopsy of right lung showed adenocarcinoma.
2.  on september 26, 2016, ct/pet scan showed right upper lobe lung mass, bilateral 
noncalcified pulmonary nodules, which were not hypermetabolic and were less than 1 cm.  
there was a mildly hypermetabolic 1.7 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion at c2 vertebral body.  an mri of the 
cervical spine revealed an enhancing lesion at c2.  cat scan of the cervical spine showed that 
it could be benign.
3.  on september 28, 2016, bronchoscopy and ebus showed no endobronchial lesions, 
pathology benign.
4.  on october 19, 2016, cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy of right paratracheal node 
showed adenocarcinoma, kras mutation present and no alk, braf, egfr, met, ros1, or 
ret mutations.  pd-l1 ihc was 30%
5.  in november 2016, hospitalization for elevated blood sugar and postobstructive pneumonia.  
cat scan of the chest showed persistent right hilar mass, mediastinal adenopathy, moderate-
to-large right pleural effusion and subcentimeter bilateral lung nodules.  thoracentesis was 
performed and pleural fluid with cytology was positive for adenocarcinoma.
6.  radiation therapy to lung and c2, november through december 2016.
7.  alimta and carboplatin at reduced dosages, december through january 2016, 2 cycles with 
stable disease, but poor tolerance with weight loss.
8.  
medical problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, history of prostate cancer and in 
november 2010, treated with radiation therapy and hormone therapy.
 
interval problems:  mr. shepherd is in my office for his regular followup.  he was 
hospitalized at upmc jameson on january 12, 2017 for shortness of breath and weakness.  he 
was treated supportively with iv fluids and antibiotics.  a chest x-ray was stable.  during 
hospitalization, mr. shepherd had hearing loss.  an mri of the brain showed atrophy and there 
were no metastasis.  he was seen by dr. callahan and was found to have wax in his ears.
 
mr. shepherd is doing very poorly.  he is weak.  he has shortness of breath at rest and worsens 
on exertion.  he continues to have chest pain.  he is not eating much and has lost weight.  his 
hearing has improved.
 
physical examination:
general:  thin, chronically ill man, in no distress.
vital signs:  weight 164 pounds, temperature 98, pulse 92, respirations 16, and blood 
pressure 122/82.
heent:  conjunctivae pink, moist, without lesions.  pupils are equal and reactive to light.  
extraocular movements are intact.  no scleral icterus.  oropharynx is moist without ulcerations 
or exudate.
nodes:  no palpable nodes in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal or femoral areas.
skin:  no ecchymoses, petechiae or rash.
lungs:  decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields.
heart:  no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  heart rate is regular.
abdomen:  soft.  bowel sounds are normal.  no hepatosplenomegaly, guarding, tenderness or 
masses.
musculoskeletal:  no pedal edema, clubbing, cyanosis or joint deformity.  no spinal 
tenderness.
neurologic:  cranial nerves are intact.  no focal motor or sensory deficits.  dtrs intact.  
gait and speech are normal.  fully oriented.
 
laboratory data:  white cell count 23,700, hemoglobin 10.4, and platelets 177,000.  sma 
and tsh are pending.
 
impression:  mr. shepherd is not doing well and it is likely multifactorial due to the cancer, 
which appears fairly stable, chemotherapy and uncontrolled diabetes.  i told mr. shepherd the 
chemotherapy was not helping him subjectively and his condition is worsening.  since his pd-l 
stain is positive, he might benefit from immunotherapy.  i told him that keytruda is an infusion 
given through the vein once every 3 weeks, it may help him or may not and the benefit is 
unpredictable as are side effects, he may have some inflammation of any organs such as 
myocarditis, nephritis, colitis causing diarrhea, pneumonitis causing shortness of breath, 
dermatitis causing rash, thyroiditis, etc.  he wanted to try something.  his wife questioned 
hospice, but after a conversation with mr. shepherd he said there was no question that he 
wanted further therapy despite potential toxicities.
 
plan:
1.  discontinue chemotherapy.
2.  keytruda 200 mg iv over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.
3.  if keytruda is not tolerated or if there is progression of disease, hospice will be consulted.
4.  i will see mr. shepherd in 3 weeks with cbc, chemistry profile, and tsh.  a cat scan will 
be done after 2-4 cycles of therapy depending on how mr. shepherd does clinically.
 
sincerely;

referring physician:  jason m. bierenbaum, m.d.
 
diagnosis:  brain metastasis.
 
code:  c79.31.
 
history of present illness:  mr. phelps returned for followup of his non-small 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases.   he  was  treated  with  stereotactic 
radiosurgery to the left frontal metastasis in august 2021.  he has been doing fairly well.  
he has had headaches for the past couple of days.  he had an mri of the brain done 
today,which showed an increase in the old treated left frontal lesion to 1.8 cm with some 
increase in surrounding t2 and flair signal changes.  there were no new lesions.
 
review of systems:  he has noted some headaches for the past couple of days.  
denied any vision change, focal weakness, difficulty walking.
 
physical examination:  
general:  he was in nad.
vital signs:  pulse 80, respirations 16, blood pressure 125/70, weight 149 pounds.
neurologic:  cranial nerves were intact.  motor function was 5/5.  gait was intact.
 
laboratory data:  x-rays were reviewed.  mri of the brain done today showed a 
1.8 cm left frontal lesion, which had increased compared to the mri from august 4, 2022 
with some increase in surrounding t2 and flair signal changes.  there were no new 
lesions.
 
assessment and plan:  mri of the brain done today showed some increase in the 
old treated left frontal lesion.  the mri from february 2022 and august 2022 with some 
increase in surrounding t2 and flair signal changes suspicious for recurrent disease.  
there were no new lesions.  plan will be for a short followup mri in 4-6 weeks.  if the left 
frontal lesion were to increase, then the plan would be to retreat with radiosurgery.
 
total time spent on today's visit was 25 minutes. this included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests,  and  time  spent 
documenting today's service.

date of visit:    12/05/2022

                                   office note 

principal  diagnosis:   history  of  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung,  pd-l1 
positive  of  10%  as  well  as  history  of  actionable  kras  mutation  in  the  form  of  kras 
q61h mutation, initially seen by dr. villaruz for a clinical trial participation.
 
most  recent  therapy  single  agent  pembrolizumab,  essentially  september  of  2021,  the 
patient completed 4 cycles of carboplatin followed by pemetrexed for roughly 4 months.
 
interval history:  roberta gibson is a pleasant 66-year-old female who returns for 
followup.  overall, she feels quite well.  no new medical problems are reported.  she is 
status post a restaging ct scan.
 
review of systems:  
general:  negative.  the patient is feeling well.
 
physical examination:  
vital signs:  stable.  she is afebrile.
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.
neck:  supple.
lungs:  clear.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm.
abdomen:  soft.
extremities:  do not show any edema, cyanosis, or petechiae.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
current medications:  amlodipine, metformin, zofran, and vitamin d.
 
imaging  studies:   personally  reviewed  and  discussed  with  the  patient.   overall, 
showing  unfortunately  recurrent  2.6  right  adrenal  metastases,  probable  slight 
progression of subcarinal tumor or new borderline left axillary adenopathy.
 
assessment and plan:  for this 66-year-old female who unfortunately has disease 
progression noted on today's visit.  i had a detailed discussion with the patient regarding 
treatment options, whether to reconsider a clinical trial participation for a kras q61h 
mutation.  unfortunately, the patient and her sister are not willing to drive to shadyside 
and  are  also  concerned  about  possible  placebo  group  participation.   i  did  discuss  her 
case  with  dr.  villaruz,  who  saw  the  patient  in  the  past  and  we  will  try  to  obtain  more 
details regarding the participation of the trial.  otherwise, should the patient not qualify or 
refuse  to  go  to  shadyside  for  the  kras  mutation,  we  can  offer  her  second  line 
docetaxel, which i also gave the patient a printout today and the risks and benefits were 
discussed.   she  can  certainly  start  this  treatment  as  soon  as  next  week.   all  other 
concerns  and  questions  were  discussed  in  detail.   we  will  see  the  patient  again  in 
roughly 3-4 weeks upon her second cycle of docetaxel and assess her tolerance to that 
drug.

we  have  also  contacted  the  patient  after  confirming  there  is  no  placebo  arm  in  the 
clinical trail, patient nevertheless opted for chemo at this time

history  of  present  illness:   rose  is  followed  by  dr.  melissa  yee  and  i  am 
covering for her today.  she is on maintenance pembrolizumab for metastatic squamous 
cell  lung  cancer.   she  was  initially  treated  with  carboplatin  and  taxol  with 
pembrolizumab and she completed 4 cycles in late october 2020.  imaging showed a 
partial response.  she has been on maintenance pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.  she 
has had a cat scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis earlier this month on december 
9,  2021,  which  basically  showed  no  obvious  significant  progression  of  disease.  
described  a  precarinal  lymph  node,  which  previously  measured  2.2  cm  and  now 
measured 2.4 cm, but that is really the only significant change from what i can see.  she 
has  no  symptoms  to  suggest  checkpoint  inhibitor  toxicity.   her  liver  enzymes  and 
creatinine today were normal.  the serum sodium is 134.  thyroid functions are normal.
 
she  tells  me  she  remains  compliant  with  her  xarelto  for  history  of  dvt.   she  is  on  a 
prophylactic dose of 10 mg daily.
 
she follows with dr. thurston for chronic pain syndrome and is on oxycodone.
 
past medical history:
1.  allergies:  ace inhibitors and penicillin.
2.  metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, thought to be of lung primary.
3.  anxiety and bipolar disorder.
4.  copd.
5.  chronic pain syndrome.
6.  cad, status post stent to rca.
7.  type 2 diabetes.
8.  fibromyalgia
9.  history of alcohol and cocaine.
10. hyperlipidemia.
11.  hypertension.
12.  history of thyroid nodules.
 
social history:  divorced and longtime smoker.  she quit drinking 6 years ago.
 
family history:  lung cancer and smoking in her father.  her mother had an mi and 
is deceased.
 
physical examination:  
general:  pleasant woman, in no distress.
skin:  without lesions.
lymphatics:  no adenopathy.
heent:  unremarkable.
lungs:  clear to p and a.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm.  normal s1, s2.
abdomen:  soft and benign. no organomegaly or masses or ascites.
extremities:  without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
neurologic:  ambulatory and alert and communicative.
 
impression:  this is a 67-year-old woman with a history of metastatic squamous cell 
lung cancer, having had previous carboplatin with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, now 
on maintenance pembrolizumab.  recent ct scan shows only 2 mm change in a mildly 
enlarged  precarinal  lymph  node  (from  2.2  cm  up  to  2.4  cm),  but  overall  no  significant 
progression.  she will go ahead with pemetrexed today and reassess in 3 weeks.

principal diagnosis:  pd-l1 positive lung cancer, stage iv, bilateral nodules, 
adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated.
 
current therapy:  ongoing pembrolizumab cycle #8 day after a very good response after 
6 treatments was noted.
 
interval history:  mr. taylor returns for followup.  overall, he remains active and works 
part-time.  he is also continuing to gain weight.

general:  negative.
enmt:  negative.
respiratory:  negative.
cardiovascular:  negative.
gastrointestinal:  negative.
genitourinary:  negative.
integument:  negative.
neurologic:  negative.
reminder of systems was reviewed and is negative.
 
physical examination:

general:  age-appropriate looking gentleman in no acute distress.
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.
neck:  supple.
lungs:  clear.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm.
abdomen:  soft.
extremities:  do not show any edema, cyanosis or petechiae.
neurologic:  he is grossly intact.
 
laboratory studies:  on today's visit show a creatinine of 1.  white count of 7.5, 
hemoglobin of 14, platelet count 338.  tsh of 4.2, free t4 of 1.
 
assessment and plan:  for this 71-year-old gentleman who overall has stable disease on 
pembrolizumab.  i made the patient aware that he should pay attention to his weight, given that, 
this is ballooned out since initiating pembrolizumab.  i asked him to maintain his weight and to 
avoid further weight gain.  otherwise, we will see him again in 3 weeks.  his tsh is fluctuating 
but free t4 is essentially stable; therefore, we will continue to follow.

assessment and plan:  71-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, atrial 
flutter,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  history  of  smoking,  who  presents  for  followup 
for  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  involvement  of  the  neck,  hilar, 
mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes, bilateral adrenal metastases, pd-l1 positive at 
1%, kras mutation g13c positive.  she is on second line atezolizumab, which she is 
tolerating well.  she will continue on atezolizumab without dose modifications.  we will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for her life-threatening illness.  we will 
schedule her for a restaging ct of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis in 6 weeks.  she 
will continue on iron supplementation daily for mild anemia with iron deficiency and we 
will obtain a cbc, complete metabolic profile, thyroid function testing, and iron studies 
today.  she will return to clinic in 6 weeks.  she will contact our office for any questions 
or concerns in the interim.

                             clinical follow-up note 

ms. pearson is a 79 year old female who presents to the clinic today for her first followup 
visit after completing treatment. to summarize her history, she was initially seen in our 
office in 2019 after being diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the right lung. she received 
radiation therapy to the right middle lobe lung tumor. she was treated with 60 gy in 15 
fractions. her treatment concluded on december 4, 2019. on followup imaging, she was 
noted to have a new left upper lobe lung mass. a pet/ct scan revealed fdg activity 
associated with the left upper lobe mass. a biopsy was not recommended due to the risk 
associated  with  the  procedure.  radiation  therapy  was  recommended  to  the  left  upper 
lobe lung tumor. the left lung tumor received 60 gy in 30 fractions, and her treatment 
concluded on september 20, 2020. she will continue to be followed closely, and in july 
2022  was  noted  to  have  a  right  lower  lobe  perihilar  nodule  that  increased  in  size 
compared to a ct scan from april 2022. the patient opted to pursue radiation therapy to 
this area as well. she received 36 gy in 12 fractions to the mass in the right lower lobe 
of the lung. her treatment concluded on august 31, 2022. she returns to the clinic today 
for her first followup visit after completing treatment.
 
mrs. pearson had a ct scan of the chest on november 21, 2022 to follow up from her 
recent  radiation.  while  in  the  radiology  department,  she  suffered  a  fall,  and  was 
subsequently seen in the emergency department. a ct scan of the head was negative. 
the results from her ct scan of the chest were reviewed with her at that time, and were 
noted  to  reveal  progressive  disease.  these  results  were  discussed  with  her  via 
telephone  by  dr.  jack  schocker  on  wednesday  november  23,  2022.  the  previously 
treated nodule within the left upper lobe has increased in size compared to the ct scan 
from july 2022. this nodule now measures 22 x 15 mm. the previously treated area in 
the  right  middle  lobe  remains  unchanged,  and  has  surrounding  stable  post-radiation 
changes. the recently treated area in the right lower lobe continues to enlarge, and is 
now eroding into the right 10th rib. again, these findings were previously discussed with 
the patient.
 
mrs. pearson is tearful during today's visit. we discussed the fact that further radiation 
therapy  is  not  indicated  at  this  time,  per  dr.  jack  schocker.  she  has  been  treated 
several  times,  and  her  disease  continues  to  progress.  systemic  therapy  would  be  an 
appropriate option at this time, although choices will likely be limited due to her multiple 
sclerosis. i spoke with dr. mohammad alkayem during our visit today, and he agrees to 
see her in the near future. she is concerned about her ongoing pain in the area of the 
destructive lesion of the posterior right 10th rib. a referral was placed to palliative care to 
discuss pain management. she reports ongoing shortness of breath, although she states 
this has not increased significantly. her main concern is quantity of life, and living to see 
her  granddaughter  get  married  in  approximately  one  year.  again,  she  is  tearful  during 
today's visit, and is difficult to engage in conversation.
 
on  exam,  she  is  alert,  oriented,  and  in  no  acute  distress.  her  neck  is  supple  with  no 
masses  or  adenopathy.  her  heart  has  a  regular  rate  and  rhythm,  and  her  lungs  have 
decreased breath sounds throughout. she has pain to palpation over the right posterior 
chest wall.
 
the patient will return to our office in two months for repeat evaluation. she will be seen 
by dr. mohammad alkayem in the near future to discuss options for systemic therapy. a 
referral  was  placed  for  her  to  be  seen  by  palliative  care  to  discuss  pain  management 
options. her questions were addressed to the best of my ability during today's visit. she 
will  contact  our  office  with  further  questions,  concerns,  or  need  to  be  seen.  this  was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  dr.  jack  schocker,  who  was  available  throughout 
today's visit.

progression over 2 years ago, for which she received gamma knife followed by initiation 
of keytruda on december 5, 2019 through august 3, 2021, at which point she stopped 
prematurely  due  to  worsening  renal  function.  in  that  regard,  she  has  required 
maintenance prednisone 1 mg daily, which is ongoing.
 
history  of  present  illness:   deb  presents  for  followup.   since  our  last  visit  3 
months ago, she did develop a cough in september that sounds viral and has lingered.  
she denies chest pain or shortness of breath as well as new bone pain or headache.

principal diagnosis:  metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
 
prior oncologic history: the patient is status post 4 cycles of carboplatin and nab-
paclitaxel with progression on second line therapy with docetaxel after 2 cycles with interval 
progression and is currently on gemcitabine
past medical history: hypertension, copd, crohn's disease. 
past surgical history: cholecystectomy, bilateral cataract removal, colon resection. 
social history: he lives with his son, has 4 children, is a widow, has a history of smoking a 
pack a day for over 70 years. 
family history: brother, lung cancer and daughter breast cancer. 
allergies: none. 
medications: combivent, vitamin d, glucosamine, norvasc, pentasa and tylenol. 
 
interim history:  stanley manheim presents to clinic for ongoing evaluation of metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, currently on gemcitabine therapy.  he reports that he is 
otherwise doing well, he is now having stable symptoms of very mild self-limited fatigue.  he 
reports he has no new symptoms from his crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and overtly denies any fever, night sweats, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, chest pain, shortness of breath, history of bleeding or rash, weakness, numbness, 
tingling, blurry vision or headache.
 
review of systems:  as per interval history, otherwise comprehensive 14-point review of 
systems is largely unremarkable.
 
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  weight 139 pounds, temperature 97.5, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 16, blood 
pressure 115/60, saturating 93% on room air.
general:  well-appearing male in no apparent distress.
heent:  moist mucous membranes.  no oropharyngeal lesions.  sclerae are anicteric.
neck:  supple, no adenopathy.
lymphatics:  no supraclavicular, cervical, axillary or thoracic adenopathy appreciated.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheeze.
cardiovascular:  normal rate, regular rhythm.  no murmurs.
abdomen:  soft, nontender, nondistended.  no hepatosplenomegaly.
extremities:  no edema, erythema, or tenderness.
neurological:  no focal deficits.
psychiatric:  cooperative and pleasant.
 
 
laboratory data:  white count 8.6, hemoglobin 11.5, platelets 349.  electrolytes reviewed 
largely stable.
 
radiographic data:  ct from march 10, 2017, showing largely stable disease, unchanged 
left lower lobe nodule at 1.8 cm and unchanged right middle lobe nodule at 3.8 cm.  no new 
lesions at this time.
 
assessment and plan:  stanley manheim is a 92-year-old gentleman with a history of 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, currently presenting for ongoing therapy with 
gemcitabine.
 
at this time, it is reassuring the patient overtly has no new symptoms and has only his chronic 
baseline fatigue, which is very mild and an ecog performance status 0-1 and is currently 
tolerating his iv gemcitabine therapy well.  it is reassuring also that his scans show no overt 
progression of disease and per our read his left lower lobe lesion and right middle lobe lesion 
are stable since his scans in january.  it is reassuring that he is otherwise overly doing well.  
we have discussed the risks and benefits of continuing therapy at this time and given the 
patient's age, he would like to proceed with therapy, but will continue to monitor should he have 
any symptoms or side effects.   the risks, benefit of continuing gemcitabine will continue to be 
readdressed. it is reassuring that he is otherwise overtly asymptomatic and doing well.  we will 
continue to monitor the patient.  
 
he will return to clinic in the next 3 weeks.  the patient's family members conveyed 
understanding regarding the risks and benefits of further workup and management as well as 
the plan set forth and they are amenable to continuing.  the patient and family members' 
questions were answered to their satisfaction.  they have the clinic information and will call in 
the interim with any new symptoms or developments.
 
end of dictated report by resident/fellow.  attending md comment 
below.
 
i was present with the resident/fellow during the key portions of the service.  i discussed the 
case with the resident/fellow and agree with the findings and plan of care as documented in the 
resident's/fellow's note.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
 
prior oncologic history: the patient is status post 4 cycles of carboplatin and nab-
paclitaxel with progression on second line therapy with docetaxel after 2 cycles with interval 
progression and is currently on gemcitabine
past medical history: hypertension, copd, crohn's disease. 
past surgical history: cholecystectomy, bilateral cataract removal, colon resection. 
social history: he lives with his son, has 4 children, is a widow, has a history of smoking a 
pack a day for over 70 years. 
family history: brother, lung cancer and daughter breast cancer. 
allergies: none. 
medications: combivent, vitamin d, glucosamine, norvasc, pentasa and tylenol. 
 
interim history:  stanley manheim presents to clinic for ongoing evaluation of metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, currently on gemcitabine therapy.  he reports that he is 
otherwise doing well, he is now having stable symptoms of very mild self-limited fatigue.  he 
reports he has no new symptoms from his crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and overtly denies any fever, night sweats, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, chest pain, shortness of breath, history of bleeding or rash, weakness, numbness, 
tingling, blurry vision or headache.
 
review of systems:  as per interval history, otherwise comprehensive 14-point review of 
systems is largely unremarkable.
 
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  weight 139 pounds, temperature 97.5, heart rate 72, respiratory rate 16, blood 
pressure 115/60, saturating 93% on room air.
general:  well-appearing male in no apparent distress.
heent:  moist mucous membranes.  no oropharyngeal lesions.  sclerae are anicteric.
neck:  supple, no adenopathy.
lymphatics:  no supraclavicular, cervical, axillary or thoracic adenopathy appreciated.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheeze.
cardiovascular:  normal rate, regular rhythm.  no murmurs.
abdomen:  soft, nontender, nondistended.  no hepatosplenomegaly.
extremities:  no edema, erythema, or tenderness.
neurological:  no focal deficits.
psychiatric:  cooperative and pleasant.
 
 
laboratory data:  white count 8.6, hemoglobin 11.5, platelets 349.  electrolytes reviewed 
largely stable.
 
radiographic data:  ct from march 10, 2017, showing largely stable disease, unchanged 
left lower lobe nodule at 1.8 cm and unchanged right middle lobe nodule at 3.8 cm.  no new 
lesions at this time.
 
assessment and plan:  stanley manheim is a 92-year-old gentleman with a history of 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, currently presenting for ongoing therapy with 
gemcitabine.
 
at this time, it is reassuring the patient overtly has no new symptoms and has only his chronic 
baseline fatigue, which is very mild and an ecog performance status 0-1 and is currently 
tolerating his iv gemcitabine therapy well.  it is reassuring also that his scans show no overt 
progression of disease and per our read his left lower lobe lesion and right middle lobe lesion 
are stable since his scans in january.  it is reassuring that he is otherwise overly doing well.  
we have discussed the risks and benefits of continuing therapy at this time and given the 
patient's age, he would like to proceed with therapy, but will continue to monitor should he have 
any symptoms or side effects.   the risks, benefit of continuing gemcitabine will continue to be 
readdressed. it is reassuring that he is otherwise overtly asymptomatic and doing well.  we will 
continue to monitor the patient.  
 
he will return to clinic in the next 3 weeks.  the patient's family members conveyed 
understanding regarding the risks and benefits of further workup and management as well as 
the plan set forth and they are amenable to continuing.  the patient and family members' 
questions were answered to their satisfaction.  they have the clinic information and will call in 
the interim with any new symptoms or developments.

                                   office note 

principal diagnoses:  adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially 11 cm metastatic mass, 
presenting with shortness of breath and pleural effusions on the right side.  the patient 
initially underwent palliative radiation followed by single agent pembrolizumab with so far 
good response.
 
interval history:  mrs. kim hunter is a pleasant 62-year-old female, who returns 
for followup.  she reports undergoing a ct scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis at magee 
hospital yesterday.  unfortunately, the read and imaging has not been uploaded so far.  
otherwise, she does not report any new medical problems.  she has chronic discomfort 
from  her  port,  which  was  evaluated  by  interventional  radiology  and  deemed  in 
functional condition without any significant limitations to the patient.
 
allergies:  penicillin.
 
current medications:  oxycodone as needed, levothyroxine, magnesium, vitamin 
d, sudafed, phenobarbital as well as nicotine patches.
 
review of systems:
general:  negative.
enmt:  negative.
respiratory:  negative.
cardiovascular:  negative.
gastrointestinal:  negative.
genitourinary:  negative.
integument:  negative.
neurologic:  negative.
psychiatric:  negative.
remainder of systems reviewed and negative.
 
physical examination:  
vital signs:  age-appropriate looking female, in no acute distress.
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.
neck:  supple.
lungs:  clear.  port over the right upper chest is functioning.
skin:  intact.
abdomen:  soft.
extremities:  do not show any edema, cyanosis or petechia.
neurological:  she is grossly intact.
 
past medical history:  significant for thyroidectomy, on chronic thyroid hormone 
replacement.
 
laboratory studies:  creatinine of 1, white count of 4.3, hemoglobin of 12, platelet 
count of 223.  albumin of 3.1.
 
assessment and plan:  for this 62-year-old female, who underwent restaging ct 
scans, unfortunately the imaging studies are not available for my review at this time in 
point.  the patient also was requesting further nicotine patches, further decrease in her 
previous dosing from 21 mg patches to now 14 mg patches, which was provided to the 
patient.   her  pain  is  managed.   the  patient  states  that  she  does  not  need  any  more 
oxycodone  at  this  time  in  point.   in  regards  of  her  lung  cancer,  we  will  continue 
pembrolizumab.  the patient was made aware that at 1 year, she will have the choice to 
participate  in  a  clinical  trial  versus  observation.   otherwise,  we  will  certainly  await  her 
currently  pending  imaging  studies.   overall,  her  functional  status  is  greatly  improved 
since  her  initiation  of  therapy.   the  patient  certainly  could  in  the  future  also  get 
carboplatin and alimta if needed for disease progression, which so far is not apparent.

imaging completed but no read or uploaded study available for review so far

dear dr. tejpar:
 
diagnoses:
1.  poorly-differentiated non-small-cell cancer, favoring poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma 
with metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes and left adrenal gland, stage iv, diagnosed in 
november 2016.
2.  in october 2016, mr. gierlach presented with transient fever, weakness, and cough which 
resolved.  on october 29, 2016, chest x-ray showed a 2.5 cm lobulated mass in the left upper 
lobe.  on november 2, 2016, a cat scan showed a 2.9 cm left upper lobe mass, abutting the 
pleura; 4 mm juxtapleural nodule in the left upper lobe; and a 2 cm left adrenal gland and bulky 
mediastinal adenopathy.  mri of the brain showed no metastasis.  in november 2016, a 
ct/pet scan showed uptake in the left upper lobe mass; 2 left cervical lymph nodes; 
hypermetabolic bulky mediastinal adenopathy; fdg-avid subcentimeter right lower lobe and left 
lower lobe nodule, suspicious for metastasis, and an fdg-avid left adrenal nodule.
3.  in november 2016, a ct-guided needle biopsy of the lung was positive for malignant cells.
4.  in 2016, ebus showed non-small-cell cancer, but none of cells to do further testing.
5.  on november 29, 2016, left vats procedure and biopsy of mediastinal lymph node showed 
poorly-differentiated non-small-cell cancer, ttf-1 and p63 negative, psa focally positive, 
favoring poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, pd-l1 of 25%.  alk, braf, egfr, kras, and 
met negative.
6.  carboplatin and alimta 1 cycle on january 30, 2017.
7.  carboplatin, alimta, and avastin, november through april 2017, three cycles with stable 
disease.
8.  alimta maintenance in april 2017.
 
interval problems:  mr. gierlach is in my office to review restaging studies following 4 
cycles of therapy.  he is feeling well.  his only complaint is having to have a foley catheter in 
place.  he went to see dr. davis at upmc, who said turp could not be done until he was off 
chemotherapy.  mr. gierlach has no symptoms regarding his lung cancer.  he says his stomach 
gets upset and has been taking zofran regularly, even when he was not nauseated.  he has 
had no vomiting, fevers, or bleeding.
 
physical examination:
general:  a well-developed, well-nourished man, in no distress.
vital signs:  weight 182 pounds, temperature 98, pulse 64, respirations 16, and blood 
pressure 164/86.
heent:  conjunctivae pink, moist, without lesions.  pupils are equal and reactive to light. 
extraocular movements are intact.  no scleral icterus.  oropharynx is moist without ulcerations 
or exudate. 
nodes:  no palpable nodes in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal, or femoral areas. 
skin:  no ecchymoses, petechiae, or rash. 
lungs:  clear to auscultation and percussion. 
heart:  no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  heart rate is regular. 
abdomen:  soft.  bowel sounds are normal.  no hepatosplenomegaly, guarding, tenderness, 
or masses.
musculoskeletal:  no pedal edema, clubbing, cyanosis, or joint deformity.  no spinal 
tenderness. 
neurologic:  cranial nerves are intact.  no focal motor or sensory deficits.  dtrs intact. gait 
and speech are normal.  fully oriented.
 
laboratory 
 
data:  white cell count 8900, hemoglobin 14.5, platelets 218,000.  sma shows an alkaline 
phosphatase of 130, creatinine 0.793.  a cat scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis reveal a 
1.5 cm left adrenal nodular enlargement; prostate enlargement; stable left upper lobe mass 
which measures approximately 4 cm; mesenteric mass, measuring 3.7 cm; a left suprahilar 
mass, measuring 4.7 cm; a retrocaval mass, measuring 5.8 cm, all of which are stable.
 
impression:  mr. gierlach has stable disease following 4 cycles of therapy and will proceed to 
maintenance.
 
i explained that there is limited evidence about which maintenance is better; alimta versus 
avastin versus both medications together, and i explained i usually use alimta as a single 
agent.
 
since mr. gierlach's disease has been stable, i will refer him to dr. wilson to see if radiation 
therapy to involved areas is feasible.  if it is, i explained to the gierlachs that chemotherapy with 
low-dose taxol and carboplatin is usually used in conjunction with radiation therapy.  he can be 
given a break between alimta and the combined modality therapy so that he could have a 
turp.
 
plan:
1.  proceed with maintenance alimta 500 mg/m2 iv with folic acid, vitamin b12, and steroid 
premedication, cycle #1.
2.  weekly blood counts and return in 3 weeks with cbc and chemistry profile.
3.  referral to dr. wilson.
 
sincerely,

oncologic history:

   1. complaints of back pain and ct scan and mri of the lumbar spine worrisome for bone 
       lesions.  pet/ct  from  19th  of  august  2019  showing  lesions  in  the  bones.  no  other 
       hypermetabolic area. myeloma panel is negative. pt had bone marrow biopsy and biopsy

   10. repeat  scans  from  4  january  2022,  7  march  2022  showing  no  evidence  of  recurrent 
       disease.

 
 
history  of  present  illness:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  braf  v600e  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  synthroid.   in  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing functional medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   she  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   her  appetite  is 
stable.   she  continues  to  walk.   she  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  she continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.
 
review  of  systems:   comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is 
otherwise negative.
 
 
medications:
acetaminophen extra strength (500 mg) capsule oral prn
advil (200 mg) capsule oral prn
allegra allergy tablet oral prn
calcium citrate +d tablet oral b.i.d.
claritin 1 (5 mg) tablet, chewable oral daily
covid-19 mrna vaccine (pfizer) intramuscular
covid-19 mrna vaccine (pfizer) intramuscular
covid-19 mrna vaccine (pfizer) intramuscular
flublok quadrivalent intramuscular
multi vitamin tablet oral
unithroid 1 tablet (of 112 mcg) oral daily
vitamin d capsule oral

allergies:
cats and house dust and mites resulting in congestion.
 
 
physical examination:  
vital signs:  today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   her  ecog 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
general:  she is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  moist mucous membranes.  oropharynx is clear.
neck:  supple, without lymphadenopathy.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
abdomen:   soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   no  hepatosplenomegaly.   hyperactive 
bowel sounds.
neurologic:   mild  bilateral  sensory  deficits  in  her  right  proximal  thigh,  left  greater 
than right.
 
laboratory data:  today, her white count is 4.7, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.7, 
platelets are 266.  cmp really unremarkable.  glucose 104.  tsh today is 0.886.
 
radiographic studies:  the patient did have a ct scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. of note, on the ct scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   we  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  so this is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones t1 and t5, which appeared to be stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
braf v600e mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   the  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  however, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. we may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. in addition, it has been 
a year since her mri given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly mri prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  the patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

platelets are 266.  cmp really unremarkable.  glucose 104.  tsh today is 0.886.
 
radiographic studies:  the patient did have a ct scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. of note, on the ct scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   we  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  so this is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones t1 and t5, which appeared to be stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
braf v600e mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   the  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  however, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. we may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. in addition, it has been 
a year since her mri given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly mri prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  the patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. of note, on the ct scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   we  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  so this is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones t1 and t5, which appeared to be stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
braf v600e mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   the  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  however, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. we may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. in addition, it has been 
a year since her mri given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly mri prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  the patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   we  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  so this is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones t1 and t5, which appeared to be stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
braf v600e mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   the  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  however, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. we may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. in addition, it has been 
a year since her mri given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly mri prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  the patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

oncologic history:

   1. complaints of back pain and ct scan and mri of the lumbar spine worrisome for bone 
       lesions.  pet/ct  from  19th  of  august  2019  showing  lesions  in  the  bones.  no  other 
       hypermetabolic area. myeloma panel is negative. pt had bone marrow biopsy and biopsy 
       of  sacral  lesion.  no  evidence  of  lymphoma.  final  pathology  consistent  with  mucin

       braf  v600e  mutation,  tp53  mutation,  pik3ca  mutation,  ms-stable;  10.9 
       mutations/mb.
   2. pd on dabrafenib/trametinib (braf/mek inhibitors) started september 2019. 
   3. started  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab  on  6/18/2020.  finished  4  cycles 
       8/20/2020.

trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  synthroid.   in  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for

be  doing  quite  well.   she  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   her  appetite  is 
stable.   she  continues  to  walk.   she  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  she continues to have left buttock

her.  so this is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones t1 and t5, which appeared to be stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
braf v600e mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   the  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  however, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. we may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. in addition, it has been 
a year since her mri given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly mri prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  the patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

       mutations/mb.
   2. pd on dabrafenib/trametinib (braf/mek inhibitors) started september 2019. 
   3. started  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab  on  6/18/2020.  finished  4  cycles 
       8/20/2020.

   5. started maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab on 9/10/2020. 
   6. scans after 4 cycles from november 19, 2020 and 1 december 2020 showing excellent 
       radiologic response. mri findings noted but no hypermetabolic activity on the bone scan.
   7. pet/ct from 17 may 2021 showing complete radiologic response
   8. s/p  cycle  #17  maintenance  therapy  with  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  enrolled  in

   10. repeat  scans  from  4  january  2022,  7  march  2022  showing  no  evidence  of  recurrent 
       disease.

 
 
history  of  present  illness:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  braf  v600e  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  synthroid.   in  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing functional medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   she  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   her  appetite  is 
stable.   she  continues  to  walk.   she  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  she continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.
 
review  of  systems:   comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is 
otherwise negative.
 
 
medications:
acetaminophen extra strength (500 mg) capsule oral prn
advil (200 mg) capsule oral prn

allergies:
cats and house dust and mites resulting in congestion.
 
 
physical examination:  
vital signs:  today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   her  ecog 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
general:  she is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  moist mucous membranes.  oropharynx is clear.
neck:  supple, without lymphadenopathy.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
abdomen:   soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   no  hepatosplenomegaly.   hyperactive 
bowel sounds.
neurologic:   mild  bilateral  sensory  deficits  in  her  right  proximal  thigh,  left  greater 
than right.
 
laboratory data:  today, her white count is 4.7, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.7, 
platelets are 266.  cmp really unremarkable.  glucose 104.  tsh today is 0.886.
 
radiographic studies:  the patient did have a ct scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. of note, on the ct scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   we  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with

scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones t1 and t5, which appeared to be stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
braf v600e mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   the  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  however, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. we may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. in addition, it has been 
a year since her mri given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly mri prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  the patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

history  of  present  illness:   this  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  braf  v600e  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  braf  mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  synthroid.   in  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing functional medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   she  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   her  appetite  is 
stable.   she  continues  to  walk.   she  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  she continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.
 
review  of  systems:   comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is 
otherwise negative.

vital signs:  today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   her  ecog 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
general:  she is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.

platelets are 266.  cmp really unremarkable.  glucose 104.  tsh today is 0.886.
 
radiographic studies:  the patient did have a ct scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. of note, on the ct scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   we  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  so this is likely atelectasis.  however, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  in addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and

principal diagnosis:  metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, high pd-l1 expression.

prior therapy:
1. pet/ct scan, february 2015 revealing a 13 mm fdg avid left upper lobe nodule as well as

revealing a 1.5 cm invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, probable acinar type with 2/2 
lymph nodes positive in the left level 5 for t1a n1 disease.
6. completed sequential chemoradiation with carboplatin and taxol followed by radiation, 
january 4, 2016, through february 23, 2016.
7. post-treatment ct scan, may 3, 2016, showed no evidence of residual disease.

metastatic carcinoma, non-small cell type. molecular studies were negative for egfr and alk-
1. pd-l1 expression was high at 91%-100%.

current therapy:  pembrolizumab 200 mg q.21 days, cycle 1, day 1 on october 3, 2017.
 
interval history:  mr. rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today for 
continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma with 
adenocarcinoma histology.  he has currently been on single-agent pembrolizumab for about a 
year and half and has having almost complete remission.  recently, he has had an upper 
respiratory viral-like infection about 3-week interval and lot of difficulty with how he feels.  
overall, he has had some increased swelling in his lower extremity.  he has had decreased 
interest in food and appetite.  he has again lost about 5 pounds over the last month and half or 
so.  he is actually up a pound from last visit we saw him, however.  he still has some 
macrocytosis and some elevated lfts, although improving.  he again declares that he is not 
drinking any alcohol at this time.  in the past, recall he has had significant difficulty with alcohol 
abuse.
 
review of systems:  no recent fevers or chills, night sweats.  no headaches or visual 
changes.  no lightheadedness or dizziness.  no cough or rhinorrhea.  he does have some sore 
throat and some hoarseness.  he has no chest discomfort.  he has some shortness of breath.  
no abdominal pain.  he has decreased appetite.  no nausea or vomiting.  no diarrhea or 
constipation.  no melena or hematochezia.  no peripheral rashes.  he does have bilateral lower 
extremity swelling.

1.  amlodipine.
2.  aspirin.
3.  clonidine.
4.  etodolac.
5.  gabapentin.

physical examination:
vital signs:  weight today 153.5 from 152.4 last visit.  temperature 98.9, blood pressure 
134/85, pulse 76, respirations 16, pulse ox 97% on room air.
general:  he is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  ecog performance status of 0.
heent:  no scleral icterus.  conjunctivae are pink.  oropharynx is clear without exudate or 
erythema.
neck:  supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
chest:  overall some decreased breath sounds in the bases, but fairly clear.
heart:  tachy, but regular.
abdomen:  soft, no obvious hepatosplenomegaly.
peripheral:  shows 1+ edema from about the mid shin down to the dorsum of the foot 
bilaterally.
 
laboratory data:  reviewed from may 24th showed white count of 7.9, hemoglobin 13.7, 
mcv 103.5, platelet count of 307.  chemistries showed sodium 128, bun and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, alt of 25, ast of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
radiology:  ct scan dated may 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  there was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  the 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
assessment and plan:  mr. rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  i believe he looks 
a little better than last time i saw him.  he still is somewhat suppressed.  he seems overtly 
depressed.  i am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  he says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time i encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  i 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  in general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
he has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which i think are probably accounting for some 
of the ct changes.  i have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  i know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  he may 
be becoming refractory to keytruda, but i doubt at this point.  i plan to take him until october 
and then stop his keytruda.  i also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  he does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  again, i am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  i 
did put him on 20 of lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  we will see him back for 
treatment on wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  if he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

mcv 103.5, platelet count of 307.  chemistries showed sodium 128, bun and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, alt of 25, ast of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
radiology:  ct scan dated may 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  there was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  the 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
assessment and plan:  mr. rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  i believe he looks 
a little better than last time i saw him.  he still is somewhat suppressed.  he seems overtly 
depressed.  i am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  he says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time i encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  i 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  in general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
he has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which i think are probably accounting for some 
of the ct changes.  i have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  i know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  he may 
be becoming refractory to keytruda, but i doubt at this point.  i plan to take him until october 
and then stop his keytruda.  i also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  he does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  again, i am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  i 
did put him on 20 of lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  we will see him back for 
treatment on wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  if he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

9. august 28, 2017, underwent biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node revealing 
metastatic carcinoma, non-small cell type. molecular studies were negative for egfr and alk-
1. pd-l1 expression was high at 91%-100%.

current therapy:  pembrolizumab 200 mg q.21 days, cycle 1, day 1 on october 3, 2017.
 
interval history:  mr. rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today for 
continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma with 
adenocarcinoma histology.  he has currently been on single-agent pembrolizumab for about a 
year and half and has having almost complete remission.  recently, he has had an upper 
respiratory viral-like infection about 3-week interval and lot of difficulty with how he feels.  
overall, he has had some increased swelling in his lower extremity.  he has had decreased 
interest in food and appetite.  he has again lost about 5 pounds over the last month and half or 
so.  he is actually up a pound from last visit we saw him, however.  he still has some 
macrocytosis and some elevated lfts, although improving.  he again declares that he is not 
drinking any alcohol at this time.  in the past, recall he has had significant difficulty with alcohol 
abuse.
 
review of systems:  no recent fevers or chills, night sweats.  no headaches or visual 
changes.  no lightheadedness or dizziness.  no cough or rhinorrhea.  he does have some sore 
throat and some hoarseness.  he has no chest discomfort.  he has some shortness of breath.  
no abdominal pain.  he has decreased appetite.  no nausea or vomiting.  no diarrhea or 
constipation.  no melena or hematochezia.  no peripheral rashes.  he does have bilateral lower 
extremity swelling.
 
current medications:
1.  amlodipine.
2.  aspirin.
3.  clonidine.
4.  etodolac.
5.  gabapentin.
6.  hydroxyzine.
7.  metoprolol.
8.  mirtazapine.
9.  omeprazole.
10.  oxycodone.
11.  spiriva.
12.  ventolin.
13.  symbicort.
14.  stool softeners.
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  weight today 153.5 from 152.4 last visit.  temperature 98.9, blood pressure 
134/85, pulse 76, respirations 16, pulse ox 97% on room air.
general:  he is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  ecog performance status of 0.
heent:  no scleral icterus.  conjunctivae are pink.  oropharynx is clear without exudate or 
erythema.
neck:  supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
chest:  overall some decreased breath sounds in the bases, but fairly clear.
heart:  tachy, but regular.
abdomen:  soft, no obvious hepatosplenomegaly.
peripheral:  shows 1+ edema from about the mid shin down to the dorsum of the foot 
bilaterally.
 
laboratory data:  reviewed from may 24th showed white count of 7.9, hemoglobin 13.7, 
mcv 103.5, platelet count of 307.  chemistries showed sodium 128, bun and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, alt of 25, ast of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
radiology:  ct scan dated may 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  there was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  the 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
assessment and plan:  mr. rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  i believe he looks 
a little better than last time i saw him.  he still is somewhat suppressed.  he seems overtly 
depressed.  i am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  he says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time i encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  i 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  in general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
he has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which i think are probably accounting for some 
of the ct changes.  i have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  i know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  he may 
be becoming refractory to keytruda, but i doubt at this point.  i plan to take him until october 
and then stop his keytruda.  i also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  he does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  again, i am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  i 
did put him on 20 of lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  we will see him back for 
treatment on wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  if he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

interim history:  mr. thompson returns today accompanied by his wife and 2 daughters for 
followup.  he was last seen in clinic on april 13th, at which time restaging scans from april 4 
were reviewed and had revealed mild progression of a right anterior lesion compared to scans 
from february 8. at that time, the decision was made to proceed with close interval followup.  
he had a repeat scan on may 9, which was overall stable.  at this time, the patient reports to be 
overall feeling very well.  his energy level is very good.  in fact, yesterday he did some yard 
work with a chainsaw.  he denies any headaches, blurring of vision or dizziness.  no chest pain, 
palpitations, dyspnea on exertion at baseline or cough.  no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
constipation, diarrhea, hematuria or dysuria.  no weakness, numbness or tingling whatsoever.  
no unintentional weight loss.
review of systems:  a full review of systems was conducted and is negative except as 
detailed above.
medications:  reviewed and unchanged from prior.
physical examination:
vital signs:  height 68 inches, weight 145 pounds, stable, temperature 98, pulse 77,

bed on november 5, 2015, status post 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed.  the patient 
overall tolerated chemotherapy quite well and he has since then been followed with surveillance 
imaging.  on april 11 he was found to have a new right lung lesion that was of indeterminate

lungs:  clear to auscultation, equal air entry.
abdomen:  soft.  no tenderness, no distension.
extremities:  no edema.  pulses felt.

laboratory data:  reviewed and they are essentially within normal limits.

assessment and plan:  nancy cerovich is a pleasant lady with
1.  malignant melanoma with metastatic disease to the lymph node and she is currently on 
treatment with opdivo.  she is doing very well and the lymph node is no longer evident and she 
is in remission with regard to the melanoma.
2.  she did have lung cancer and we did do stereotactic radiation and she was in remission and 
most recent pet scan shows that she is in remission.  continue with observation.
3.  she does have a new lesion in her anterior mediastinum and it is pretty fdg avid, and i 
would recommend getting another cat scan and if it shows any progression, i will probably look 
into the biopsy and even if it is stable disease, possibly we should look into getting a biopsy.

interval  history:   ms.  smith  is  here  for  history  of  unresectable  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the lung, progressive. ct scan, september 15, 2022, showed new right-
sided rib metastasis.  there was an expansile lytic met in the anterior 6th rib.  the mass 
invaded  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing  multiple  hilar  structures,  which 
demonstrated  reocclusion  of  the  left  superior  pulmonary  vein,  though  no  change  in 
background pulmonary fibrosis.  the patient has been declining chemotherapy and was 
on keytruda at that time.  at her last visit, the patient discussed starting chemotherapy 
with  taxol  and  carboplatin.   she  is  here  today  to  start  that  chemotherapy.   the 
chemotherapy  has  been  on  hold  because  of  covid  at  the  beginning  of  october.   on 
october 24, the patient continued to have discolored sputum from her cough and was 
still  not  feeling  well.   the  patient  then  was  admitted  to  st.  margaret's  hospital, 
september 16th due to left shoulder pain and was found to have a pathologic fracture of 
the left clavicle with large soft tissue mass involving the bone.  she then went on to have 
a  detailed  course  of  2d  technique  radiotherapy  for  palliative  treatment  of  her  bone 
metastasis.   the  patient  was  discharged  on  november  18th  to  skilled  nursing  facility.

with  keytruda  and  had  12  doses,  then  she  was  noted  to  have  a  right-sided  rib 
metastasis  and  plan  was  to  start  taxol  and  carboplatin.   the  patient  then  developed 
covid  and  recovered  from  covid,  so  treatment  was  delayed.   she  then  was 
hospitalized and discharged from st. margaret's hospital on november 18th.  she was 
found to have a left shoulder pathologic fracture of the left clavicle with large soft tissue 
mass  involving  the  bone.   she  completed  2d  technique  radiotherapy  for  palliative 
treatment of her bone metastasis.  the patient was then discharged to skilled nursing 
facility.  she went to the er on november 30th and was noted to be dehydrated.  she 
was  rehydrated  and  released.  the  patient  signed  herself  out  of  skilled  nursing  facility 
and is now living at home.  she is here today and request to have her chemotherapy 
treatment  today.   the  patient  is  aware  that  treatment  can  cause  life-altering  or  life-
threatening side effects.  the patient to call our office for any side effects.  encouraged 
her  to  increase  her  fluid  intake  and  eat  small  meals.   we  will  continue  to  monitor  the 
patient closely for toxicities of treatment.  all the patient's questions were answered to 
her satisfaction.  she is to follow up in our office in 3 weeks or sooner if indicated.

                             clinical follow-up note 

mr. nebgen is an 84 year old gentleman seen for a followup visit in the office today.  the 
patient is accompanied to the exam room by his wife.  to review the patient's history, the 
patient was found to have nodules in his right lung.  in january 2021, the patient had a 
ct-guided biopsy of a right apical lung mass.  pathology showed adenocarcinoma.  a 
biopsy was then performed of a right middle lobe mass.  pathology showed squamous 
cell carcinoma.  a pet/ct scan was then performed.  the radiologist described three 
intensely  hypermetabolic  right  lung  masses.   two  nodules  were  located  in  the  right 
upper lobe and one was in the right middle lobe.  there is no evidence of mediastinal 
metastasis.   the  patient  received  concurrent  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy.  
radiation  therapy  was  given  to  all  three  hypermetabolic  lung  nodules.   the  patient 
received 60 gy in 30 fractions.  the patient completed treatment on june 15, 2021.  the 
patient  received  one  treatment  of  immunotherapy,  however,  had  poor  tolerance.  
therefore, immunotherapy was discontinued. 
 
information for today's visit was obtained by both the patient and his wife.  the patient 
states he was experiencing back pain.  he had an x-ray performed at tyrone hospital 
ordered by his primary care physician.  the patient was told he had arthritic changes.  
he goes on to state he was seen by dr. mohammad alkayem one day ago.  he was told 
by dr. alkayem that he had a compression fracture.  the patient goes on to state his 
primary care physician referred him to a neurologist.  he was started on namenda.  the 
patient's  wife  has  noticed  an  improvement  in  the  patient's  memory  since  starting  the 
medication.  the patient's wife goes on to state the patient will have an mri of the brain 
performed in december 2021.  the patient continues to have a cough.  he states his 
cough is intermittent and unchanged.  he has no hemoptysis.  he has no chest pain or 
pain with deep inspiration.  the patient states he has no unusual shortness of breath.  
he has no sore throat or difficulty swallowing.  he reports no headache or dizziness.  he 
states  with  the  exception  of  his  back  pain,  he  has  no  other  skeletal  discomfort.   the 
patient states his appetite is good and he is able to tolerate a regular diet.  the patient's 
wife  states  the  patient  is  not  as  active  as  he  was  in  the  past,  stating  he  is  rather 
sedentary. his review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
on exam today, the patient's weight is 151 pounds.  this is a ten pound increase from 
his  last  visit  in  july  2021.   no  cervical  or  clavicular  lymphadenopathy  is  appreciated.  
the patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  his heart has a regular rate and 
rhythm.   the  patient's  abdomen  is  soft  and  nontender.   the  patient  had  a  ct  of  the 
chest performed on november 10, 2021.  i had the opportunity to review the images with 
dr. schocker prior to the patient's appointment today.  there is a decrease in the size of 
the  right  upper  lobe  apical  lung  nodule.  fibrotic  changes  were  seen,  thought  to  be 
related to the patient's radiation therapy.
 
the  patient  is  clinically  doing  well.   upon  review  of  dr.  mohammad  alkayem's  office 
note, it appears a ct of the chest was requested to be performed in four months.  the 
patient's wife states the scan will be performed in march 2022.  therefore, we will see 
the  patient  back  in  our  office  in  early  april  2022.   the  patient  and  his  wife  are 
encouraged to call with any questions or concerns they may have. this was discussed 
and agreed upon with dr. schocker.  dr. mark alden was available during the patient's 
appointment today.

                                   office note

 diagnoses:
1.  small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage, presenting as mediastinal adenopathy 
for which he completed 4 cycles of vp-16 and carboplatin with cycles 2 and 3, utilizing 
concurrent radiation.
2.  distant history of a stage iv non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, egfr and 
alk negative with mutated kras at presentation.  he initially underwent surgical resection 
in september 2012, with what appeared to be a locally advanced process with path 
demonstrating involvement of 7 of 14 lymph nodes.  postop, he completed 4 cycles of 
adjuvant alimta and cisplatin, but unfortunately was found to have brain metastases in 
september 2013 for which he received gamma knife.  in january 2018, there was concern 
for a new right lung lesion, prompting a pet scan that confirmed uptake, followed by 
cyberknife to the lesion x3 in april 2018, after which he entered in observation.

history of present illness:  john returns for followup.  since our last visit, he did 
complete chemoradiation and now has undergone a pet scan, which will be summarized 
below.  he was able to quit smoking in july 24.  he denies new bone pain and actually 
reports his energy levels are improving.

review of systems:  the remainder of his 11-point review of systems was negative.

physical examination:
vital signs:  blood pressure 143/88, vital signs otherwise stable.  pain score is 0.  ecog 
performance status 0.
heent:  pupils equally round and reactive to light.  eomi.  anicteric sclerae, moist mucus 
membranes without exudate, erythema, or hemorrhage.
neck:  supple.
lymph node:  negative.
chest:  clear.
heart:  regular, not tachycardic.
abdomen:  soft, nontender without organomegaly.
back:  without cva or spine tenderness.
extremities:  without edema.
neurologic:  nonfocal and intact.

diagnostics:  labs dated july 16, 2019, white count 7.1, hemoglobin 11.5, platelet count 
98,000.  cea at that point was 3.6.  mri of the brain on august 26, 2019 was negative.  
pet/ct on august 29, 2019 failed to demonstrate new or progressive disease and there 
was marked improvement of the previous studies, although there were still a few slightly 
enlarged nodes and mild pet avidity.

impression:
1.  small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage as outlined.
2.  distant history of a non-small cell lung cancer.

plan:  at this point, based on the near complete response, i have recommended followup 
with radiation oncology to discuss possible prophylactic cranial irradiation, although i am 
not sure he is a candidate given his past history of gamma knife.  at this point, he is 
concerned about the potential for dementia and thus will discuss this further with dr. mehta 
prior to making a decision.  from the standpoint of his small cell lung cancer, i have 
recommended a short interval repeat cat scan in 2 months after which i will decrease to q. 
3-month imaging through year 1.  he will need a q. 6-8 week port flush in the interim and i 
have asked him to keep me informed of new headache, bone pain, abdominal pain, or other 
new health issues.

                                    office note

primary diagnosis:  malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus or lung.
 
principal diagnosis:  santo mascellino is a 73-year-old gentleman with metastatic non-
small cell lung ca of adenocarcinoma histology with an underlying egfr exon 19 deletion 
mutation.
 
current therapy:  the patient is on afatinib 30 mg once daily that was started on june 12, 
2015.  he is currently presenting for his 3-month followup visit with ct scans.
 
interim history:  mr. mascellino was last seen in clinic on april 28, 2016 and since then, he 
reports to have done relatively well with his current treatment afatinib.  he reports epistaxis over 
the course of last few weeks where they occur on average 1-3 times per day, spontaneously.  
they last up to 1-2 minutes and are self-resolving, amount up to 1 teaspoon.  a maximum of 3 
episodes occurred yesterday.  otherwise, they typically occur once a day.  recently, he went on 
vacation at ocean city, maryland and had a wonderful time with his wife.  he has history of a 
rash with afatinib; however, that is under control at that time and mainly involving the upper 
chest and back area.  paronychia, which has been an ongoing issue for him, is now resolved 
and was prescribed doxycycline as needed on the previous visit.  he also reports symptoms of 
heartburn and has found relief with zantac and tums as needed.  he denies fevers, chills, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or weight loss.  he reports to be feeling well, good 
appetite and good p.o. intake.  no headaches or blurry vision.
 
review of systems:  as per hpi.  all other comprehensive organ ros are normal and 
negative.
 
medications:cephalexin, flovent hfa, fluticasone propionate, fluzone
physical examination:
vital signs:  temperature 97.6, pulse 68, respirations 16, blood pressure 118/72, o2 
saturation of 99%.  pain 0, fatigue 0.  weight 179 pounds.
general:  appears stated age, in no apparent distress.
heent and neck:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  
extraocular muscles intact.  sclerae are anicteric.  conjunctivae clear.  oropharynx is clear 
without erythema or exudate. neck is supple.  no masses.
respiratory:  decreased breath sounds at left base with dullness to percussion, otherwise 
normal breath sounds in the other lung fields.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs.
abdomen:  normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  no 
hepatosplenomegaly.
extremities:  no peripheral edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  paronychia resolved at his left 
foot.
musculoskeletal:  good range of motion.  no obvious weakness.
skin:  resolved chest and neck rash/acne.
neurologic:  nonfocal exam.  normal gait.
psychiatric:  good mood and affect.
 
laboratory data:  wbc 5.6, hemoglobin 14.3, platelets 204.  sodium 142, potassium 4.5, 
chloride 106, bicarbonate 29.6, bun 17, creatinine 1.0, calcium 9.4, magnesium 2.3, phos 3.3.  
lfts all within normal limits.  ldh 182.
 
imaging studies:  ct of the chest done today, july 21, 2016 showed no change in ct 
appearance of the chest and upper abdomen from previous ct imaging studies performed on 
april 28, 2016.  no measurable change in size of residual nodule in the superior segment of left 
lower lobe.  no change in size, density or appearance of ground-glass nodule in apical portion 
of the left upper lobe.  areas of scarring in periphery of left upper lobe were noted.  chronic 
loculated right pleural effusion with adjacent area of rounded atelectasis in the right lower lobe 
were also noted.  no enlarged lymph nodes.  negative evaluation for metastatic disease in the 
upper abdomen.
 
assessment and plan:  this is mr. santo mascellino who is a 73-year-old man with a 
history of metastatic non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with an underlying egfr exon 19 
deletion mutation, who is currently on afatinib 30 mg once daily, which he has well tolerated and 
responded since june 12, 2015.  his ct scan of the chest today demonstrated stable disease 
with known left pleural effusion and scarring.  we have reviewed his imaging results with our 
patient and his wife today and we recommend that he will continue with afatinib at 30 mg daily.
 
his rash has nearly resolved and only occurs occasionally.  paronychia has also resolved with 
doxycycline prescribed on the last visit.  his new complaint of epistaxis is mild grade 1 and we 
would like to monitor it very closely.  we advised him to apply pressure if epistaxis does not 
resolve on its own.  we emphasized that he should call us if he has worsening of his epistaxis 
or develops any new symptoms.  
we will see him back in clinic in 3 months with a followup ct scan at that time.

icd-10 code:  c34.11.
 
interval since treatment:  three months.
 
interval history:  ms. witherite is a 66- year- old woman with a history of prior 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for left upper lobe non-small cell lung 
cancer.  she was then developed an enlarging right upper lobe nodule.  mri brain and pet/ct 
were negative for disease elsewhere.  biopsy was suboptimal sampling, but showed atypical 
cells, suv uptake was 4.33 on september 22, 2020, pet/ct.  the nodule in question was 
treated with sbrt 48 gy in 4 fractions from october 27, 2020 to november 4, 2020.  treatment 
was well tolerated without acute side effects. following receipt of sbrt,  she also had no side 
effects: no cough, no fatigue, no shortness of breath.
 
review of systems:  denies lack of appetite, denies fever, denies cough, denies 
hemoptysis, denies chest pain.  twelve -point review of systems was obtained and was 
negative.
 
physical examination:
general:  ecog 1.  seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
vital signs:  temperature 98.5, pulse 93, respirations 16, blood pressure 114/71, oxygen 
saturation 98% on supplemental oxygen.
eyes:  anicteric sclerae.  no lid lag.  perrl.
ent:  ears and nose appear normal.  oropharynx obscured by mask.
neck:  trachea midline.  no thyromegaly.
lungs:  breathing comfortably on supplemental oxygen.  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
abdomen:  soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
lymphatic:  no appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
psych:  alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.  
 
imaging:  i personally reviewed the available imaging consisting of a ct chest without contrast 
obtained earlier today, which shows that the treated right upper lobe nodule has nearly 
completely resolved.  there is only minimal linear opacification along the minor fissure left in its 
place.  there is no sign of radiation pneumonitis, nor fibrosis.  there is no sign of disease 
elsewhere.  overall, this is a favorable response to treatment.
 
assessment and plan:  ms. witherite is a 66- year- old woman who underwent sbrt 48 
gy in 4 fractions for an empiric non-small cell lung cancer, although did have atypical cells on 
the biopsy specimen.  she has had almost a complete response to sbrt.  she is without any 
side effects attributable to radiotherapy.  we will continue to follow and plan to see her back in 3 
months in coordination with dr. villaruz.

treatment narrative:  this is a 66-year-old white male, ex-smoker, past medical 
history  significant  for  coronary  artery  disease,  status  post  mi  and  stent  placement, 
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, arthritis, gastroesophageal reflux 
disease, hypercholesterolemia, also was diagnosed with a clinical stage iib t3 n0 poorly 
differentiated carcinoma, favor non-small cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine feature of 
the left upper lobe with an 8.9 cm mass in the left upper lobe, extending to the hilum and 
mediastinum, status post vats and pleural and diaphragm biopsy as well as left pleural 
effusion negative for the malignancy, and also level 7 and left level 4r lymph nodes all 
negative for the metastasis and due to the significant concurrent medical history, he is 
not  a  good  candidate  for  any  surgeries,  subsequently  was  treated  with  concurrent 
chemotherapy with carboplatin/ taxol weekly as well as the imrt to the left upper lobe 
/l.hilum & mediastinal area and boost up to the 66 gy in 33 fractions.  rt finished on 
february 5, 2018. and then he had a repeat ct scan, which showed a partial response.  
subsequently,  was  followed  with  the  immunotherapy  with  durvalumab  until  april  2019, 
and  ct  scan  showed  a  good  response,  interval  decreased  size  of  the  left  upper  lobe 
mass,  and  was  followed  with  repeat  ct  scan.   in  july  2020,  mri  of  the  brain  was 
negative,  but  restaging  pet/ct  scan  in  december  2020,  showed  fdg  avid  left  lower 
lobe nodule, 1.8 cm, concern disease recurrence, but ct-guided biopsy in january 2020 
was negative for the malignancy.  a repeat ct scan showed a decreased size of the left 
lower  lobe  nodule,  but  pet/ct  scan  on  june  7,  2020,  showed  this  right  upper  lobe 
nodule with 11 x 9 cm with fdg uptake and otherwise there is no evidence in the fdg 
avid metastatic disease, subsequently had a ct-guided biopsy, which was positive for a 
modulated  differentiated  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  subsequently  was  seeing  dr. 
stephanie kim, what appeared to be second primary cancer,  and was followed with dr. 
baker  and  it  was  felt,  is  not  a  good  candidate  for  subsequently,  recommended 
stereotactic  body  radiation  and  otherwise   recently  presented  with  a   chest  tightness 
and sob, and was felt to be heart problem, was followed with the cardiologist and has 
been prescribed sublinqual nitroglicerine sublingual, had some relief, subsequently was 
treated with sbrt to rul nodule according to the treatment summary above, and the 
patient  did  tolerate  treatment  and  only  slightly  tired  after  rt,  otherwise,  there  is  no 
complaint and no longer had chest pain or sob.  the patient will follow with dr. baker 
with a followup ct scan and we will follow him with dr. baker and the patient had been 
decided to schedule for the third boost with covid-19, but will check with his primary

principal  diagnosis:   history  of  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung,  pd-l1 
positive at 10% as well as actionable kras mutation q61h.
 
current therapy:  second cycle of docetaxel.
 
interval  history:   roberta  is  a  pleasant  66-year-old  female  who  returns  for 
followup.   she  recently  was  noted  to  have  disease  progression  while  being  on  single 
agent pembrolizumab for roughly 1 year.  otherwise, since initiating docetaxel, it is noted 
that the targeted therapy for kras mutation she is harboring has been approved, which 
is of a viable next line option.  otherwise, on today's visit, the patient complains of some 
dry cough.
 
current medications:  amlodipine, metformin, zofran, vitamin d.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
review of systems:  
general:  dry cough reported.
remainder of systems reviewed and unchanged.
 
physical examination:  
vital signs:  age-appropriate looking female, in no acute distress.  ecog is 0.
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.
lungs:  clear.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm.
abdomen:  soft.
extremities:  do not show any edema, cyanosis or petechia.
neurologic:  the patient is grossly intact.
 
laboratory studies:  white count of 19, hemoglobin of 9.9, platelet count of 342.  
tsh of 2.9, creatinine of 1.4 and stable.
 
assessment  and  plan:   for  this  66-year-old  female  with  adenocarcinoma  of  the 
lung, kras positive for mutation.  at this time point, the patient will continue with single 
agent docetaxel.  we will get a chest x-ray to further workup her dry cough.  otherwise, 
should  her  complaints  persist,  we  can  repeat  imaging  after  3  cycles  of  treatment  and 
decide  what  to  do  next.   certainly,  the  cough  is  intermittent.   otherwise,  she  is  doing 
quite well.  we will see her again in 3 weeks.

1.  the patient received 4 cycles of induction therapy with 1 cycle of cisplatin, taxotere, 
and 3 cycles of carboplatin and taxol for stage iii disease.
2.  the patient underwent bilobectomy right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node  dissection  in  january  2021  revealing  2.8  cm  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  40% 
viable tumor, 1.7 cm separate adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe, negative margins, 
no  lymphovascular  invasion,  1/11  lymph  nodes  involved,  ypt1c  n1a  squamous  cell

metoprolol,  omeprazole,  clonazepam  p.r.n.,  eliquis,  prednisone,  iron  sulfate  325  mg 
daily, and she is on a steroid taper.
 
interval history:  the patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  she 
was last seen on october 20, 2022.  since that time, she continued on pembrolizumab.  
she also received a dose of zometa on october 21st for hypercalcemia.  her appetite is 
good.  her energy level is moderate.  she has some intermittent dyspnea with exertion.  
she has some diffuse arthritis, which has been worse over the past few weeks and she 
was started on a steroid taper by her rheumatologist this week with some improvement.  
she has had no bleeding.  she has had no recent infections.  she has had no fevers, 
chills,  headaches,  chest  pain,  cough,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  constipation,

laboratory studies:  from october 20th, white blood cell count 5.1, hemoglobin 
11.0,  hematocrit  32.1,  platelets  170.   thyroid  function  testing  was  normal.   from 
november 10th, basic metabolic profile is significant for a creatinine 1.76, calcium 8.7.
 
radiologic  studies:   mri  of  the  brain  from  november  30th  showed  stable  to 
minimally increased size of left temporal ring-enhancing metastasis, punctate metastasis 
in the posterior left temporal lobe is new, new left frontal opercular metastasis, and the 
right frontal opercular punctate metastasis seen in august is barely perceptible on the 
current study.
 
assessment and plan:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  she initially had stage iii 
disease  and  she  had  recurrence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  after  receiving  induction 
chemotherapy  and  surgery.   she  is  status  post  carboplatin,  abraxane,  and 
pembrolizumab  chemoimmunotherapy  for  4  cycles,  and  she  is  now  receiving 
pembrolizumab maintenance.  she underwent cyberknife radiation therapy to the brain 
metastases  in  august.   i  reviewed  her  mri  of  the  brain  from  yesterday,  which  shows 
possibly 2 new areas of brain metastases.  she has an appointment to see dr. burton 
next week and i will contact him regarding the results of the mri of the brain.  for now, 
she  will  continue  on  pembrolizumab  without  dose  modifications.   we  will  plan  for 
restaging  ct  of  the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  in  6  weeks.   we  will  obtain  a  cbc, 
complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies  today.   we  will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  she has 
hypercalcemia associated with malignancy and she will have a repeat basic metabolic 
profile  in  3  weeks  and  we  will  administer  additional  zometa  as  necessary.   she  will 
continue  on  iron  sulfate  daily.   she  will  continue  on  eliquis  for  her  recent  splenic 
infarction,  which  is  likely  related  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.  
she will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

restaging  ct  of  the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  in  6  weeks.   we  will  obtain  a  cbc, 
complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies  today.   we  will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  she has 
hypercalcemia associated with malignancy and she will have a repeat basic metabolic 
profile  in  3  weeks  and  we  will  administer  additional  zometa  as  necessary.   she  will 
continue  on  iron  sulfate  daily.   she  will  continue  on  eliquis  for  her  recent  splenic 
infarction,  which  is  likely  related  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.

was last seen on october 20, 2022.  since that time, she continued on pembrolizumab.  
she also received a dose of zometa on october 21st for hypercalcemia.  her appetite is 
good.  her energy level is moderate.  she has some intermittent dyspnea with exertion.  
she has some diffuse arthritis, which has been worse over the past few weeks and she 
was started on a steroid taper by her rheumatologist this week with some improvement.  
she has had no bleeding.  she has had no recent infections.  she has had no fevers, 
chills,  headaches,  chest  pain,  cough,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  constipation, 
abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.
 
review of systems:  negative except for as described above.
 
physical examination:  
vital  signs:   temperature  97.7,  heart  rate  54,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
138/98, weight 140 pounds.  performance status is 1.
general:  in no acute distress, comfortable.
heent:  no oral lesions.
neck:  no palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs.
pulmonary:  lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheezing.
abdomen:   soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   positive  bowel  sounds.   no  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
chest:  left-sided mediport in place.
extremities:   no  edema  of  her  lower  extremities.   no  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.
skin:  no rashes or lesions are identified.
lymphatics:  no palpable lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
neurologic:  alert and oriented x3.  no focal neurologic deficits.
 
laboratory studies:  from october 20th, white blood cell count 5.1, hemoglobin 
11.0,  hematocrit  32.1,  platelets  170.   thyroid  function  testing  was  normal.   from 
november 10th, basic metabolic profile is significant for a creatinine 1.76, calcium 8.7.
 
radiologic  studies:   mri  of  the  brain  from  november  30th  showed  stable  to 
minimally increased size of left temporal ring-enhancing metastasis, punctate metastasis 
in the posterior left temporal lobe is new, new left frontal opercular metastasis, and the 
right frontal opercular punctate metastasis seen in august is barely perceptible on the 
current study.
 
assessment and plan:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  she initially had stage iii 
disease  and  she  had  recurrence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  after  receiving  induction 
chemotherapy  and  surgery.   she  is  status  post  carboplatin,  abraxane,  and 
pembrolizumab  chemoimmunotherapy  for  4  cycles,  and  she  is  now  receiving 
pembrolizumab maintenance.  she underwent cyberknife radiation therapy to the brain 
metastases  in  august.   i  reviewed  her  mri  of  the  brain  from  yesterday,  which  shows 
possibly 2 new areas of brain metastases.  she has an appointment to see dr. burton 
next week and i will contact him regarding the results of the mri of the brain.  for now, 
she  will  continue  on  pembrolizumab  without  dose  modifications.   we  will  plan  for 
restaging  ct  of  the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  in  6  weeks.   we  will  obtain  a  cbc, 
complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies  today.   we  will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  she has 
hypercalcemia associated with malignancy and she will have a repeat basic metabolic 
profile  in  3  weeks  and  we  will  administer  additional  zometa  as  necessary.   she  will 
continue  on  iron  sulfate  daily.   she  will  continue  on  eliquis  for  her  recent  splenic 
infarction,  which  is  likely  related  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.  
she will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

                             clinical follow-up note

history of present illness:  robert returns for followup today.  he was last seen in 
followup by me on april 2015 after he had been treated for metastatic lung cancer with radiation 
therapy directed to l1 through l3 vertebral body, receiving a dose of 30.0 gy in 10 fractions.  
he has since been under the care of dr. sulecki.  most recently, he has been on tarceva with 
stable disease.  he reports that most recently over the past 2 months, he has developed some 
pain in the right flank area, which he get to be a level of 7/10.  he does take ibuprofen, which 
seems to improve it.  of note, he complains that the pain is more notable when he lifts 
something, but does not really notice it when lying down or sitting or ambulating.  denies any 
other areas of bony pain.  denies any focal weakness.
 
review of systems:  complete remaining review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
physical examination:
general:  the patient in no acute distress.
vital signs:  weight is 287 pounds, blood pressure 152/80, pulse 50.
lymphatics:  no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy was palpable.
lungs:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.
abdomen:  soft, nontender.  no hepatosplenomegaly.  no masses noted.
musculoskeletal:  punch percussion of axial skeleton did not reveal any areas of bony 
tenderness.
neurologic:  revealed cranial nerves ii-xii were intact.  motor strength was 5/5 in upper 
and lower extremities and symmetrical.  gait was normal.  finger-to-nose without dysmetria.  
mini-mental status examination revealed the patient to be alert and oriented x3.
 
radiographic studies:  the patient had a ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis done with 
contrast on february 21, 2017, which i did personally review myself, which shows sclerotic 
lesions involving most of l2 vertebral body.  there is also a sclerotic lesion involving l1 
vertebral body.  the smaller lesions involving additional thoracic vertebral bodies consist 
including t2 and t6, and t9 vertebral bodies.  i did compare the cat scan to the previous cat 
scan from august 12, 2016, which did show increase in the size of the lesions involving t2 and 
t9 vertebral bodies, and the l1 and l2 vertebral bodies seemed to be unchanged.
 
impression and plan:  a 55-year-old gentleman with metastatic nonsmall cell lung 
carcinoma with pain in the right flank area.  the pain is not reproducible.  i suspect this may be 
more muscular or possibly coming from the l1-l2 region and radicular in nature because of 
nerve root involvement.  considering the findings on t2 and t9 vertebral body and the location 
where he points to the pain, these lesions do not explain the patient's symptoms.  in view of this, 
i have recommended an mri of the thoracic and lumbar spine to further evaluate this. i will 
follow up on the results and the patient will see me after the mri is done to discuss any further 
intervention.  i will discuss this further with dr. sulecki.

past 6 weeks.
 
prior therapy:
1.   the  patient  underwent  left  lower  lobectomy  in  july  2018  revealing  poorly 
differentiated  adenocarcinoma  involving  the  visceral  pleural  surface,  focal 
lymphovascular invasion.  one out of one lymph nodes involved.  pathologic stage t2 
n1, stage iib.
2.  the patient received 4 cycles of carboplatin and alimta in the adjuvant setting.
3.  the patient was found to have a new right upper lobe nodule concerning for residual 
disease.   she  underwent  right  upper  lobe  anterior  segmentectomy  in  february  2019, 
which showed invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins, t1b n0.
4.  the patient was found to have left adrenal nodule with fdg uptake in july 2019.  she 
underwent  left  adrenalectomy  in  august  2019,  which  showed  a  2.5  cm  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma with negative margins.
5.  the patient was found to have fdg-avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy and several 
bilateral pulmonary nodules and she was started on systemic therapy.
6.  the patient was started on carboplatin, taxol, and pembrolizumab for 4 cycles and

interval history:  the patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  she 
was last seen on november 29, 2022.  since that time, her pembrolizumab has been on 
hold.   due  to  concern  for  possible  pneumonitis,  she  has  been  on  prednisone  10  mg 
daily; however, her dyspnea with exertion has not improved and has actually worsened 
over the past few weeks.  she is wearing 5 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula at night and 
she wakes up at night with shortness of breath.  her appetite is moderate.  her energy 
level  is  low.   she  has  occasional  headache.   she  has  chronic  cough.   she  has  had 
diarrhea for the past week and she has been taking imodium as needed.  she has some 
abdominal cramping associated with bowel movements over the past week as well.  she

11.1, hematocrit 33.9, platelets 247.  from november 29th, complete metabolic profile 
significant for creatinine of 1.07.  tsh 1.48, free t4 of 1.4.
 
assessment  and  plan:   85-year-old  female  with  a  history  of  deep  venous 
thrombosis,  status  post  ivc  filter,  now  on  lovenox  due  to  recent  left  lower  extremity 
deep  venous  thrombosis  and  xarelto  failure,  atrial  fibrillation,  gastroesophageal  reflux 
disease,  prior  stroke,  cerebral  hemorrhage,  history  of  anxiety,  mild  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease,  history  of  localized  breast  cancer  10  years  ago,  who  presents  for 
followup for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially stage iib disease, now with 
recurrence in the right upper lobe after surgery and chemotherapy.  she developed left 
adrenal  metastases,  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy.   tumor  is  pd-l1  positive,  kras 
mutation  positive.   no  actionable  mutations  identified.   she  has  been  receiving 
pembrolizumab  maintenance,  but  this  was  held  over  the  past  6  weeks  due  to 
immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis.  she has been on prednisone 10 mg daily, but her 
breathing has gotten worse.  she had a ct of the chest due prior to this appointment, 
but she was unable to go due to diarrhea.  we will continue to hold the pembrolizumab 
as she is clinically worse.  we will obtain a chest x-ray due to concern for possible right 
pleural effusion based on my exam today and we will plan for repeat ct of the chest as 
soon as possible.  for now, she will continue on prednisone.  we will continue to hold 
the pembrolizumab and she will continue on lovenox for history of thrombosis.  we will 
tentatively make an appointment for return to clinic in 6 weeks.  her methotrexate has 
been  recently  held  by  her  rheumatologist  and  she  was  due  to  start  arava,  but  i 
recommend  holding  this  until  she  is  feeling  better.   for  now,  she  will  continue  on 
imodium for the diarrhea, but if this worsens or if her breathing worsens, she may need 
to go to the emergency department for further evaluation.  she will contact our office for 
any questions or concerns in the interim.

dear dr. malvar:
 
mrs. vasquez presents today for followup of stage iv adenocarcinoma of the lung, currently on 
opdivo.  on march 21, 2019, she had a cat scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which 
showed no evidence of progression.  she has a stable right upper lobe nodule 2 x 1.6 cm and 
no evidence of any other disease.  she does have a right hilar lymph node 2.8 cm in size.  she 
reports some dysesthesia in her fingertips, but is otherwise without complaints.  she is finding it 
more difficult to continue to come to the cancer center in beaver and wishes to follow up further 
at upmc in new castle.
 
she actually initially was seen by dr. simon in new castle in approximately december 2014.  
she initially underwent resection of the left lower lobe nodule approximately in april 2014 for a 
t2an0m0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, that looks subtypes of papillary, acinar, 
and lepidic, 3.5 x 2.8 x 3.5 cm incised.  followup in august 2014 with ct scan showed multiple 
pulmonary nodules and further followup in december 2014 showed these are not glucose avid.  
the nodules continued to increase and she was evaluated by ryan levy, md.  and by dr. kaul 
on november 2, 2015.  she got a biopsy of her right lower lobe nodule which showed recurrent 
adenocarcinoma of the lung, ttf-1 positive, ck7 positive, ck20 negative.  this had a lepidic 
growth pattern.  egfr was negative and alk1 was negative.  this was performed at heritage 
valley beaver.  at that time, although additional driver mutations were not available and they 
have not been performed.  she was treated with carboplatin and alimta from march 8, 2016, to 
may 17, 2016, followed by alimta maintenance until august 10, 2016.  in october 2016, she had 
an increase in the pulmonary nodules, so on november 2, 2016, she was started on opdivo 
with a complete response and continues to do well on this regimen.
 
review of systems:  all systems reviewed and as per hpi.
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  weight is 148 pounds, temperature 98.5, pulse 67, respirations 16, blood 
pressure 165/58, o2 saturation 100%, pain 0/10, fatigue 0/10.
general:  sitting comfortably in no apparent distress.
eyes:  conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis.  pupils and irides are 
equal and normally reactive to light.  extraocular movements are intact, without scleral icterus.
ears, nose, mouth and throat:  nasal mucosa, septum, and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear.  oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudate.
nodes:  there are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal area.
skin:  no abnormal nevi, ecchymoses, petechiae, rashes or masses on inspection or palpation.
chest:  lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
cardiovascular:  auscultation of the heart reveals no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  carotid 
arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
abdomen:  no hepatosplenomegaly, guarding, tenderness or masses.  bowel sounds are 
normal.
musculoskeletal:  extremities show no edema, clubbing, cyanosis or joint deformity.  no 
tenderness on percussion of the spine.
 
impression:  metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.
 
assessment and plan:  continue opdivo consistent with the fda dosing recommendation.

dear dr. malvar:
 
mrs. vasquez presents today for followup of stage iv adenocarcinoma of the lung, currently on 
opdivo.  on march 21, 2019, she had a cat scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which 
showed no evidence of progression.  she has a stable right upper lobe nodule 2 x 1.6 cm and 
no evidence of any other disease.  she does have a right hilar lymph node 2.8 cm in size.  she 
reports some dysesthesia in her fingertips, but is otherwise without complaints.  she is finding it 
more difficult to continue to come to the cancer center in beaver and wishes to follow up further 
at upmc in new castle.
 
she actually initially was seen by dr. simon in new castle in approximately december 2014.  
she initially underwent resection of the left lower lobe nodule approximately in april 2014 for a 
t2an0m0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, that looks subtypes of papillary, acinar, 
and lepidic, 3.5 x 2.8 x 3.5 cm incised.  followup in august 2014 with ct scan showed multiple 
pulmonary nodules and further followup in december 2014 showed these are not glucose avid.  
the nodules continued to increase and she was evaluated by ryan levy, md.  and by dr. kaul 
on november 2, 2015.  she got a biopsy of her right lower lobe nodule which showed recurrent 
adenocarcinoma of the lung, ttf-1 positive, ck7 positive, ck20 negative.  this had a lepidic 
growth pattern.  egfr was negative and alk1 was negative.  this was performed at heritage 
valley beaver.  at that time, although additional driver mutations were not available and they 
have not been performed.  she was treated with carboplatin and alimta from march 8, 2016, to 
may 17, 2016, followed by alimta maintenance until august 10, 2016.  in october 2016, she had 
an increase in the pulmonary nodules, so on november 2, 2016, she was started on opdivo 
with a complete response and continues to do well on this regimen.
 
review of systems:  all systems reviewed and as per hpi.
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  weight is 148 pounds, temperature 98.5, pulse 67, respirations 16, blood 
pressure 165/58, o2 saturation 100%, pain 0/10, fatigue 0/10.
general:  sitting comfortably in no apparent distress.
eyes:  conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis.  pupils and irides are 
equal and normally reactive to light.  extraocular movements are intact, without scleral icterus.
ears, nose, mouth and throat:  nasal mucosa, septum, and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear.  oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudate.
nodes:  there are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal area.
skin:  no abnormal nevi, ecchymoses, petechiae, rashes or masses on inspection or palpation.
chest:  lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
cardiovascular:  auscultation of the heart reveals no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  carotid 
arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
abdomen:  no hepatosplenomegaly, guarding, tenderness or masses.  bowel sounds are 
normal.
musculoskeletal:  extremities show no edema, clubbing, cyanosis or joint deformity.  no 
tenderness on percussion of the spine.
 
impression:  metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.
 
assessment and plan:  continue opdivo consistent with the fda dosing recommendation.  
she does have some interest in stopping the therapy if possible. she will follow up at the  
upmc cancer center in new castle.  if there are any additional questions or anything that i can 
do to help with transition and care, do not hesitate to contact me.

                                   office note 

history of present illness:  harold is a 71-year-old gentleman known to me for 
history  of  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  currently  receiving  keytruda 
monotherapy after initial treatment with carboplatin, taxol, keytruda.  he returns today 
for followup.  he is feeling reasonably well without really any new problems.  he denies 
any diarrhea.  denies any fever, chills, night sweats.  energy has been better.  appetite 
has been fairly good.
 
past  medical,  family,  social,  and  surgical  history:   reviewed  and 
unchanged since prior documentation.
 
medications and allergies:  documented in the chart.
 
review  of  systems:   assessed.   pertinent  described  in  history  of  present  illness.  
remainder of review of systems was negative.
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  reviewed and documented in nursing flow sheet.
general:  this is an african-american gentleman, thin, but not cachectic.  he is in no 
apparent distress.
heent:  sclerae are anicteric.  mucous membranes are moist.  oropharynx clear.
heart:  regular.
lungs:  clear bilaterally.
abdomen:  soft.
extremities:  show no clubbing, cyanosis, edema.
skin:  warm, dry and intact.
neurologic:  grossly nonfocal.  cranial nerves ii-xii are intact.
psychiatric:  alert, oriented, appropriate, and pleasant.
 
laboratory data:  reviewed.
 
assessment  and  plan:   harold  is  a  71-year-old  gentleman  with  metastatic  lung 
cancer with excellent response to initial carboplatin, taxol, keytruda.  he had insufficient 
tissue  for  pd-l1  thus  his  status  remains  unknown.   he  is  now  receiving  keytruda 
maintenance  after  relatively  poor  tolerance  of  initial  chemotherapy  and  a  very  good 
response.  this is taken with every 3-week dosing for the time being with the option to 
potentially move to every 6-week if he continues to do well.  we will refill lasix, which he 
had previously been on due to some edema.  he does not need to take it every day, he 
can take it as needed for edema.  see him back in 3 weeks.  continue to monitor tsh, 
cbc, cmp.

date of birth:      08/03/1948
date of visit:      09/11/2019

                                   consultation

diagnoses: left lung ca, clinical stage iv (t2a, n0, m1); lll adenoca s/p 10 gy sbrt 
followed by 40 gy; ebrt completed 7/16/19. now presenting with progressively worsening left 
shoulder pain due to lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum.
icd-10 code: c34.32, c79.51
consultation: freda is a 71-year-old white female who is well-known to our department, 
having just recently completed a course of potentially curative radiotherapy to the lll 1o tumor 
and adjacent left hilum and mediastinum; she did receive 40 gy of external beam rt following a 
single 10 gy sbrt treatment administered by dr. steve burton at upmc shadyside in 
pittsburgh (sbrt was discontinued 2o to concern about high potential gastric radiation dose).
since completing treatment, freda has been feeling extremely weak and tired. however, her 
most bothersome problem has been progressively worsening pain in her left shoulder. recent 
radionuclide bone scan (8/30/19) had shown some increased uptake in the inferior aspect of the 
glenoid labrum of the left scapula, corresponding to an area of lytic lesion, which had previously 
been identified on chest ct (6/18/19). this is now felt to be clearly consistent with metastatic 
disease. in addition, focal areas of uptake was seen in left posterior 9th and 10 ribs, which were 
felt to represent healing rib fractures. a subtle focus of increased radionuclide uptake was seen 
in the mid-shaft of the left femur, which was felt to be 2o to possible metastatic lesion. left 
shoulder mri (8/23/19), had shown a slightly displaced fracture through the blade of the 
scapula, and there was some bone marrow edema seen along the superior and posterior 
margin of the glenoid process (which could potentially represent metastatic disease).
from a respiratory standpoint, freda's status has been fairly stable, although she does report 
significant exertional dyspnea even with relatively minimal activity. unfortunately, her appetite 
has been very poor, and she has lost an additional seven pounds since completing radiotherapy 
on 7/16/19.
medical/surgical/family/social history: see previous consultation (6/6/19).
examination:
vital signs: weight: 94.4 pounds. height: 61"". bmi= 17.9 kg/m2. pulse: 106 min-1. 
respirations: 16 min-1 (unlabored). blood pressure: 155/75 mmhg. oxygen saturation= 95% 
(room air at rest). karnofsky performance status= 70%.
skin: 1-2+ residual hyperpigmentation posteriorly, no desquamation apparent.
heent: oral cavity without apparent candidiasis.
lymph nodes: no adenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or peri-umbilical regions.
chest: trachea midline, no suprasternal fullness.
lungs: clear bilaterally with fairly good aeration and the bronchial breath sounds previously 
present centrally on the left were much less prominent. peak expiratory flow= 130 liters/minute 
(41% predicted).
cardiac: regular rhythm. no audible murmurs or gallops.
abdomen: non-tender. liver span= 8.0 cm.
skeletal: there is mild-to-moderate tenderness with palpation about the glenoid socket of 
the shoulder joint posteriorly. no pain on upward percussion of the left humerus. mild 
tenderness in the mid left femur (~20 cm below the top of the greater trochanter). no other 
significant tenderness with percussion along spinal axis, over the pelvic bones, chest wall 
(including left posterior 9th and 10 ribs), right femur and bilateral humeri.
impression: left lung ca, clinical stage iv (t2a, n0, m1); lll adenoca s/p 10 gy sbrt 
followed by 40 gy; ebrt completed 7/16/19. freda presents with her first definite manifestation 
of distant metastatic disease, now with progressively worsening left shoulder pain due to 
destructive lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum. she also manifests highly 
suspicious tenderness corresponding to a positive bone scan finding in the left mid-femur (which 
is a ""weight-bearing bone""). 
detailed discussion was held freda and her son regarding the indications, technique, potential 
side effects and anticipated results from palliative radiotherapy directed at this left scapular 
metastatic lesion. i stressed to them that her papillary serous endometrial ca has been 
documented previously to be highly radioresponsive in that joan had achieved essentially 
complete response at the end of 45 gy pelvic rt, and addition of the ~24 gy from the syed 
hdr brachytherapy implant resulted in long-term locoregional tumor control. furthermore, i 
stressed that since her lower extremity motor strength is essentially fully preserved, and she 
does also retain quite adequate sensory function, i am optimistic that she may be able to regain 
ambulatory status.
side effects of treatment in joan's case should be manageable. there may be some possibility 
for radiation esophagitis due to exit dose from treating the thoracic spine; this can usually be 
managed effectively with oral topical anesthetic agents (i.e. viscous lidocaine) and insertion of 
a planned 5-7 day treatment break in mid-treatment course. with treatment to the chest, there 
may also be some risk for radiation pericarditis and/or pneumonitis; both of these conditions are 
usually responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 
at completion of our discussion, joan and her daughter expressed their understanding of the 
proposed radiotherapy treatment, its goal of pain relief and prevention of further neurologic 
deficits. joan did sign an informed consent to receive this palliative mid-thoracic spine 
radiotherapy.
plan: joan did undergo ct treatment planning simulation immediately following our 
consultation. we will be undertaking 3d-conformal treatment planning later today in order to 
design a conformal treatment plan to deliver 30 gy (3.0 gy x 10 fractions) to the t6-t9 vertebral 
levels encompassing the left paraspinal mass at t7-t8. total treatment duration will be two-
weeks, but there is a high likelihood that she will require a mid-course treatment break to allow 
for resolution of radiation esophagitis.

significant exertional dyspnea even with relatively minimal activity. unfortunately, her appetite 
has been very poor, and she has lost an additional seven pounds since completing radiotherapy 
on 7/16/19.
medical/surgical/family/social history: see previous consultation (6/6/19).
examination:
vital signs: weight: 94.4 pounds. height: 61"". bmi= 17.9 kg/m2. pulse: 106 min-1. 
respirations: 16 min-1 (unlabored). blood pressure: 155/75 mmhg. oxygen saturation= 95% 
(room air at rest). karnofsky performance status= 70%.
skin: 1-2+ residual hyperpigmentation posteriorly, no desquamation apparent.
heent: oral cavity without apparent candidiasis.
lymph nodes: no adenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or peri-umbilical regions.
chest: trachea midline, no suprasternal fullness.
lungs: clear bilaterally with fairly good aeration and the bronchial breath sounds previously 
present centrally on the left were much less prominent. peak expiratory flow= 130 liters/minute 
(41% predicted).
cardiac: regular rhythm. no audible murmurs or gallops.
abdomen: non-tender. liver span= 8.0 cm.
skeletal: there is mild-to-moderate tenderness with palpation about the glenoid socket of 
the shoulder joint posteriorly. no pain on upward percussion of the left humerus. mild 
tenderness in the mid left femur (~20 cm below the top of the greater trochanter). no other 
significant tenderness with percussion along spinal axis, over the pelvic bones, chest wall 
(including left posterior 9th and 10 ribs), right femur and bilateral humeri.
impression: left lung ca, clinical stage iv (t2a, n0, m1); lll adenoca s/p 10 gy sbrt 
followed by 40 gy; ebrt completed 7/16/19. freda presents with her first definite manifestation 
of distant metastatic disease, now with progressively worsening left shoulder pain due to 
destructive lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum. she also manifests highly 
suspicious tenderness corresponding to a positive bone scan finding in the left mid-femur (which 
is a ""weight-bearing bone""). 
detailed discussion was held freda and her son regarding the indications, technique, potential 
side effects and anticipated results from palliative radiotherapy directed at this left scapular 
metastatic lesion. i stressed to them that her papillary serous endometrial ca has been 
documented previously to be highly radioresponsive in that joan had achieved essentially 
complete response at the end of 45 gy pelvic rt, and addition of the ~24 gy from the syed 
hdr brachytherapy implant resulted in long-term locoregional tumor control. furthermore, i 
stressed that since her lower extremity motor strength is essentially fully preserved, and she 
does also retain quite adequate sensory function, i am optimistic that she may be able to regain 
ambulatory status.
side effects of treatment in joan's case should be manageable. there may be some possibility 
for radiation esophagitis due to exit dose from treating the thoracic spine; this can usually be 
managed effectively with oral topical anesthetic agents (i.e. viscous lidocaine) and insertion of 
a planned 5-7 day treatment break in mid-treatment course. with treatment to the chest, there 
may also be some risk for radiation pericarditis and/or pneumonitis; both of these conditions are 
usually responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 
at completion of our discussion, joan and her daughter expressed their understanding of the 
proposed radiotherapy treatment, its goal of pain relief and prevention of further neurologic 
deficits. joan did sign an informed consent to receive this palliative mid-thoracic spine 
radiotherapy.
plan: joan did undergo ct treatment planning simulation immediately following our 
consultation. we will be undertaking 3d-conformal treatment planning later today in order to 
design a conformal treatment plan to deliver 30 gy (3.0 gy x 10 fractions) to the t6-t9 vertebral 
levels encompassing the left paraspinal mass at t7-t8. total treatment duration will be two-
weeks, but there is a high likelihood that she will require a mid-course treatment break to allow 
for resolution of radiation esophagitis.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  mr. maiorano is a 68-year-old gentleman presenting for ongoing 
treatment and evaluation of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology.
 
he is currently presenting for cycle 2, day 1 of carboplatin and pemetrexed.
 
oncologic history:  briefly, he was initially diagnosed after having presented with 
progressive shortness of breath at which point in time, a ct scan demonstrated extensive 
thoracic adenopathy, parenchymal lung disease within the right lower lobe and a large right-
sided pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.  biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node 
demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma with mutational testing, which was negative for 
egfr, alk, ros1 and pd-l1.  it was at that point in time that he was recommended for 
initiation of systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed.  he completed whole brain 
radiotherapy to multiple metastatic lesions to the cns at the beginning of march of 2017.
 
interim history:  mr. maiorano returns to the office today for interim followup.  he really 
feels quite well and tolerated his first cycle of chemotherapy really without much by way of 
treatment-related side effects.  he was able to continue all of his day-to-day activities without 
any significant fatigue, decrease in appetite or weight loss.  he is making a conscious effort with 
the help of his son to eat a bit more healthy.  he does complain of his persistent sinus drainage 
which has been a long-term issue in addition to some sensation of fullness in both ears without 
any discrete pain.
 
review of systems:  his comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  demonstrate a temperature of 97.2, his blood pressure is 140/70, pulse rate 71, 
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
general:  he is a caucasian male in no acute distress.
heent:  reveals no scleral icterus.  no oropharyngeal lesions.
neck:  stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring 
up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at this point in time
heart:  regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
lungs:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
abdomen:  nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  no palpable masses.
extremities:  he has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
neurologic:  he is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
skin:  reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
musculoskeletal:  reveals no acute defect.
 
laboratory data:  his white count is 3.0 with an anc of 2.3.  his hemoglobin is 11.3.  his 
platelet count is 252.  his comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits with the 
exception of a borderline glucose of 107.
 
assessment and plan:  mr. maiorano is a 68-year-old gentleman presenting for ongoing 
treatment and evaluation of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology.  
he is currently presenting for cycle 2, day 1 of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed.  
it is notable that he actually tolerated his first cycle really quite well and as such, i would like to 
proceed with his second cycle of therapy today.
 
on physical exam, it does seem as though he has stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of 
the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at 
this point in time.  there is also some shotty lymphadenopathy throughout the fossa, which i 
think is also fairly stable, though perhaps a bit more mobile than on prior occasions.  we will 
proceed with therapy at this point in time and as he seems to have at least stable disease, at 
least on physical exam; we will plan to restage him at the conclusion of 4 cycles of carboplatin 
and pemetrexed or sooner should any issues arise.  it is notable that we did complete molecular 
profiling here, he was noted to be negative for c-met and ret by fish and also negative for 
braf, kras and met mutation by ngs.  alk and egfr were also negative by ngs and pd-
l1 is negative.  we also did send peripheral blood genotype using foundation act and is 
notable only for tp53 mutation.  we will continue therapy at this point it in time.  we will see the 
patient back in 3 weeks' time or sooner should any issues arise.

personally review those images today.  as noted by the radiologist, there is no longer 
any  abnormal  fdg  uptake  in  the  thoracic  cavity.   this  suggests  a  very  favorable 
response to the previous treatment.  however, there is a new area of abnormality in the 
upper abdomen.  specifically, there is a 1 cm mass with intense fdg uptake in the area 
of the head of the pancreas or possibly a lymph node.  dr. zhang is going to request a 
contrast enhanced ct of the abdomen and pelvis to try to better delineate this issue.  if 
appropriate, a biopsy might be an option.  i will wait to hear from dr. zhang, and can 
also see the patient at a future date if necessary.

                                   consultation

diagnosis:  small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, limited stage.
icd-10 code:  c34.32.
referring physician:  dr. silvia coleman, dr. peter daloni and dr. chad smith.
reason for consultation:  prophylactic cranial irradiation after completion of systemic 
chemotherapy with complete remission.
ronald valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 fdg-avid left lung lesions on 
pet/ct scan october 26, 2020.  one is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  on november 23, 2020, he underwent left vats, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  lymph node study was negative.  then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  then, restaging study, april 13th ct scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  mri of the brain april 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  he is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
past medical history:  atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
past surgical history:  prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, vats in november 2020, tonsillectomy.
current medications:  allopurinol, colchicine, coumadin, covid vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, lopressor, losartan, norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
allergies:  he is allergic to adhesive tape.
social history:  he has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  he drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
family history:  one sister had lung cancer.
review of systems:
constitutional:  he complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
integumentary:  unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
head:  unremarkable.
eyes:  he denies double vision or blurred vision.
ent:  he has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  he 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
respiratory:  unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
cardiovascular:  he has atrial fibrillation, on coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
gastrointestinal:  unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
genitourinary:  unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
musculoskeletal:  he has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
endocrine:  he has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
neurologic:  he had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  he 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
hematology:  he denies easy skin bruising.
laboratory findings:  we do not have a recent blood test, but on november 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, bun 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated gfr 68.  
wbc 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
imaging studies:  i personally reviewed pet/ct scan on october 26, 2020.  mri of the 
brain and most recent ct of the chest findings are stated in hpi.
physical examination:
general:  reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
vital signs:  he weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
heent:  there is no facial asymmetry.  extraocular movement is normal.
neck:  there is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
lungs:  showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
heart:  showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
lymphatics:  there is no murmur.
abdomen:  benign.
rectal:  deferred.
extremities:  without edema.
neurological:  reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  otherwise, unremarkable.
impression:  an 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by ct of the chest and mri 
of the brain on april 13, 2021.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

plan and recommendation:  ideally, i would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 gy, 2.5 gy per fraction.  however, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  i would like to leave this issue to 
dr. iheagwara.  also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

integumentary:  unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
head:  unremarkable.
eyes:  he denies double vision or blurred vision.
ent:  he has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  he 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
respiratory:  unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
cardiovascular:  he has atrial fibrillation, on coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
gastrointestinal:  unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
genitourinary:  unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
musculoskeletal:  he has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
endocrine:  he has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
neurologic:  he had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  he 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
hematology:  he denies easy skin bruising.
laboratory findings:  we do not have a recent blood test, but on november 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, bun 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated gfr 68.  
wbc 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
imaging studies:  i personally reviewed pet/ct scan on october 26, 2020.  mri of the 
brain and most recent ct of the chest findings are stated in hpi.
physical examination:
general:  reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
vital signs:  he weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
heent:  there is no facial asymmetry.  extraocular movement is normal.
neck:  there is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
lungs:  showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
heart:  showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
lymphatics:  there is no murmur.
abdomen:  benign.
rectal:  deferred.
extremities:  without edema.
neurological:  reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  otherwise, unremarkable.
impression:  an 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by ct of the chest and mri 
of the brain on april 13, 2021.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

plan and recommendation:  ideally, i would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 gy, 2.5 gy per fraction.  however, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  i would like to leave this issue to 
dr. iheagwara.  also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

principal diagnosis:  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology 
without any actionable mutation. current therapy:  mr. wable was induced with 4 cycles 
of carboplatin and pemetrexed and is currently on maintenance pemetrexed, presenting for 
cycle 43 today.  he is receiving pemetrexed every 4 weeks. interval history:  mr. wable 
is a very pleasant 66-year-old man with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma 
histology without any actionable mutation.  he was last seen in clinic on march 28, 2017.  he 
continues to do very well and has little by way of subjective complaints today.  he is having 
cataract surgery on thursday.  his only complaint today is intermittent lower extremity 
claudication which he has followed with a vascular surgeon for in the past.  he states that he 
needs an intervention and will be scheduling with a vascular surgeon soon.  he had restaging 
ct scans completed this morning.  he denies fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, cough or night sweats.  he denies any 
recent hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or illnesses.  he states that his appetite is good 
and his weight has been stable.  he states his energy level is good and he is able to do his day-
to-day activities without any difficulty. allergies:  no known drug allergies. review

performed this morning which showed:chest:1.  no significant change in residual left hilar 
mass.2.  right lung nodules unchanged.  no new nodules.3.  small hilar and mediastinal nodes 
unchanged.  no new adenopathy.4.  stable exam compared to january 3, 2017.abdomen:1.  
negative evaluation for metastatic disease in the abdomen.2.  unchanged appearance of aortic 
aneurysm, status post endovascular stent repair.3.  no change from prior study. assessment 
and plan:  mr. wable is a very pleasant 66-year-old man with metastatic nonsmall cell lung 
cancer of adenocarcinoma histology with no targetable mutation, currently on maintenance 
pemetrexed.  he continues to do very well.  he denies any subjective complaints at today's visit.  
his only issue is intermittent lower extremity claudication for which he follows with a vascular 
surgeon.  he states that he will need an intervention and we advised him to let us know if and 
when an intervention is scheduled, so that we can decide if we need to hold his pemetrexed 
therapy at that time.  he is scheduled to have cataract surgery on one of his eyes this upcoming 
thursday and will have the other eye operated on in one month.  he had restaging ct scans 
today, which showed stable disease.  given the fact that he has little by way of disease or 
treatment related symptoms at this time, we will continue with maintenance pemetrexed 
therapy.  we will see the patient back in one month for pemetrexed maintenance therapy at that 
time.  we will obtain another ct scan in 4 months on august 15, 2017.  all of the patient's 
questions and his sister's questions were answered to their satisfaction.  if they have any issues 
or concerns in the interim, they are encouraged to contact our office. end of dictated 
report by pa-c.  attending md comment below. i have personally spoken with the 
patient, reviewed today's pa-c's progress note for this patient and agree with the findings as 
documented.  today the key element(s) of service that i personally provided are as follows: i 
have personally formulated the treatment plan and discussed in detail with the patient.

                                   office note 

history of present illness:  this patient is a 68-year-old white female who has 
a known diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung.  she was transferred to norwin office 
because  of  the  insurance  coverage.   she  initially  had  lung  cancer  in  december  2015.  
her initial stage was stage iiib adenocarcinoma of the lung with mediastinal lymph node 
metastasis (4r, 4l and station 7).  her staging was t1b n3 m0.  she received combined 
chemotherapy and radiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.  she had recurrence in 
may of 2018 on routine followup scan.  a pet/ct scan showed 4.5 cm mass in the right 
lower lobe.  she received chemotherapy with carboplatin and alimta in september 2018 
followed  by  cyberknife  treatment.   her  ct  scan  in  september  of  2019  showed  no 
evidence  of  recurrent  cancer.   a  ct  scan  of  the  chest  at  forbes  regional  hospital  in 
december  2019  showed  a  prominent  right  lower  lobe  consolidation.   it  was  difficult  to 
compare  that  to  the  previous  pet/ct  scan.   i  ordered  a  pet/ct  scan  that  showed 
increased uptake in the right hilar area with suv over 10.6.  it also showed increased 
consolidation in the right lower lobe with suv over 5.76.  the patient was referred to dr. 
michael szwerc.  he did a bronchoscopy with ebus.  the pathology revealed recurrent 
adenocarcinoma.   her  pd-l1  was  10%.   the  molecular  study  showed  no  targetable 
mutation.  however, she had a positive kras mutation.  now the targetable treatment 
for kras mutation is available.  the pathology also showed mss features.  the tumor 
mutation  burden  was  4.4.   she  received  keytruda,  alimta  and  carboplatin.   she 
developed  hypersensitivity  reaction  to  carboplatin.   in  july  of  2021,  she  developed 
shortness of breath.  she was admitted to the hospital for bronchitis.  she was treated 
with doxycycline and steroids.  she had a ct scan of the chest that showed negative for 
pe  and  stable  disease.   a  repeat  pet/ct  scan  on  may  10,  2021,  showed  triangular 
consolidation  in  the  superior  segment  of  the  right  lower  lobe,  increased  uptake 
compared  to  the  pet/ct  scan  on  september  11,  2020.   she  had  a  bronchoscopic 
examination  on  june  3,  2021,  that  confirmed  recurrent  cancer  with  adenocarcinoma.  
she was enrolled in the clinical trial hcc21-019 with sotorasib, kras inhibitor.  she is 
doing very well with a good response.  a ct scan on july 23, 2022, showed minimal 
interval increase in size of a mass-like density in the right lung extending into the right 
hilum.  overall picture is consistent with stable disease.  from the beginning, her tumor 
had 20% shrinkage.
 
past  medical  history:   hyperlipidemia,  lung  cancer,  tubal  ligation,  copd, 
hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 
social history:  she continues to smoke a few cigarettes a day.  she tried to quit 
smoking, but not successful.  she drinks socially.  she has a very good support from her 
husband.
 
family history:  her mother had cervical cancer.
 
allergies:  contrast dye, keflex, nicoderm, and carboplatin.
 
home medications:  albuterol inhaler, aspirin 81 mg daily, b12 at 1000 mcg daily, 
breo ellipta daily, doxepin 10 mg daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg daily, 
potassium 40 meq b.i.d.  she had pfizer covid-19 vaccine x3.
 
review of systems:  she does not have any significant changes from the previous 
symptoms.  she has occasional cough and occasional shortness of breath, most likely 
from copd and chronic smoking.  the rest of 10-point review of systems is negative.
 
physical examination:
vital  signs:  blood  pressure  105/61,  pulse  105,  respirations  16,  temperature  97.2, 
weight 111 pounds.
general: well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.
heent: no jaundice, normal pharynx. extraocular muscles intact.
neck: no palpable lymph nodes.
lungs: clear to percussion and auscultation.
heart: regular rhythm.
abdomen: no organomegaly, no palpable mass.
lymph node survey: no palpable axillary or inguinal lymph nodes.
extremities: no pedal edema. no petechiae.
neurologic: no focal signs.
 
laboratory  data:   cbc:   wbc  4900,  hemoglobin  13.7,  platelets  227,000.   the 
chemistry profile showed sodium 140, potassium 3.7, bun 21, creatinine 0.74.  her last 
ferritin level went down to 79.  her b12 level was 968 and folate level was greater than 
24.
 
impression:
1.  recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung, stable disease with sotorasib per clinical trial, 
hcc21-019.

principal  diagnosis:   metastatic  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain 
metastases.
 
current  therapy:   pembrolizumab  every  3  weeks,  status  post  4  cycles  of 
carboplatin, abraxane, pembrolizumab.  she also received cyberknife radiation therapy 
to the left posterior temporal and left frontal brain lesions on december 16th.
 
prior therapy: 
1.  the patient completed 4 cycles of induction therapy, 1 cycle of cisplatin and taxotere 
and 3 cycles of carboplatin and taxol for stage iii disease.
2.  the patient underwent bilobectomy, right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node  dissection  in  january  of  2021  revealing  a  2.8  cm  squamous  cell  carcinoma  with 
40%  viable  tumor,  1.7  cm  separate  adenocarcinoma  of  the  right  lower  lobe,  negative 
margins, no lymphovascular invasion.  one out of 11 lymph nodes involved, ypt1c n1a 
squamous cell carcinoma, t1b n0 adenocarcinoma.
3.  the patient had disease progression on bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound and 
biopsy of the right hilar mass showed recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.
4.  the patient received cyberknife radiation therapy to the right frontal and left temporal 
brain metastasis in august of 2022.

showed new 4 mm right upper lobe nodule, no change in the mildly enlarged high right 
mediastinal lymph node.  no other areas of disease identified.
 
assessment and plan:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  of  metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  she initially had stage iii 
disease and had recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma after induction chemotherapy 
and  surgery.   she  is  status  post  carboplatin,  abraxane,  pembrolizumab 
chemoimmunotherapy  for  4  cycles  and  is  now  receiving  pembrolizumab  maintenance.  
she  has  received  cyberknife  radiation  therapy  in  august  of  2022  and  again  in 
december, which she tolerated well and she will have a followup mri of the brain in the 
next few months.  i reviewed the ct of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which shows a 
new 4 mm right upper lobe nodule of uncertain significance.  the remainder of her ct 
scan appears stable.  this may be an area of recurrence; however, we will repeat a ct 
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in 3 months to evaluate this further.  for now, she will 
continue on pembrolizumab without dose modifications.  we will continue with intensive 
monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  we will obtain a cbc, complete 
metabolic  profile,  and  thyroid  function  testing  today  and  she  will  have  a  repeat  basic 
metabolic  profile  in  3  weeks.   if  she  has  worsening  hypercalcemia,  we  will  administer 
additional  zometa  as  necessary.   she  will  continue  on  eliquis  for  her  prior  splenic 
infarction,  which  was  likely  due  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.  
she will return to clinic in 6 weeks and she will contact our office for any questions or 
concerns in the interim.

                             clinical follow-up note

diagnosis:  non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.

icd code:  c34.

referring physician:  afaq ahmad, md; steven a burton, md; ranga patri, md; inderpal 
s sarkaria, md;

history of present illness:  margaret umbel is a 55-year-old female who returns to 
radiation oncology clinic for regular followup.  she had 2 radiation oncology treatment one in 
july 2018, stereotactic body radiation therapy to the left lung lesions, 54 gy in 3 fractions by dr. 
burton at shadyside hospital.  then, she developed recurrent/second malignancy in the chest 
in 2018 by pet/ct scan on december 4, 2018, showing left upper lobe, mediastinal, and 
internal mammary node lesions for which she received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, 60 
gy in 30 fractions, completed on march 19, 2019.  she had a pet/ct scan in june 2019, which 
showed significant decrease of fdg-avid lesions near complete remission.  a repeat pet/ct 
scan on february 4, 2020, shows no evidence of tumor or significant radiation related side 
effect in the thorax.  she does not have fever, night sweating, or weight loss.  she does not 
have unusual headache, osseous pain except for chronic back pain for which she takes 
ibuprofen.  she currently smokes small amount of cigarette.  she uses oxygen when it is 
needed at home.  she has chronic shortness of breath, but denies unusual cough or 
hemoptysis.  she does not have gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptomatologies.  she 
denies visual, hearing, or speech impairment.  she denies gait abnormality.

physical examination:
general:  she appears to be in good condition, alert and oriented, in no acute distress.
vital signs:  she weighs 117 pounds, temperature 98.6 fahrenheit, pulse 102, blood 
pressure 126/68, respirations 22, and oxygen saturation 93% at ambient air.
heent:  there is no facial asymmetry.  extraocular movement is normal.
neck:  there is no lymphadenopathy in the neck.
lungs:  showing very limited air movement with scattered wheezing, consistent with copd.
heart:  showing regular rhythm without murmur.
abdomen:  benign.
extremities:  without edema.
neurologic:  unremarkable.  there is mild punch tenderness in the spine.

impression:  margaret umbel is doing well, although she has chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease for which she requires oxygen when it is needed.  today, oxygen saturation is 93% at 
ambient air.  therefore, we encouraged her to see a pulmonologist and home 
oxygenation/continuous oxygen therapy.  we recommended her to return to radiation oncology 
clinic in 6 months for followup examination.

                             clinical follow-up note

diagnosis:  non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.

icd code:  c34.

referring physician:  afaq ahmad, md; steven a burton, md; ranga patri, md; inderpal 
s sarkaria, md;

history of present illness:  margaret umbel is a 55-year-old female who returns to 
radiation oncology clinic for regular followup.  she had 2 radiation oncology treatment one in 
july 2018, stereotactic body radiation therapy to the left lung lesions, 54 gy in 3 fractions by dr. 
burton at shadyside hospital.  then, she developed recurrent/second malignancy in the chest 
in 2018 by pet/ct scan on december 4, 2018, showing left upper lobe, mediastinal, and 
internal mammary node lesions for which she received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, 60 
gy in 30 fractions, completed on march 19, 2019.  she had a pet/ct scan in june 2019, which 
showed significant decrease of fdg-avid lesions near complete remission.  a repeat pet/ct 
scan on february 4, 2020, shows no evidence of tumor or significant radiation related side 
effect in the thorax.  she does not have fever, night sweating, or weight loss.  she does not 
have unusual headache, osseous pain except for chronic back pain for which she takes 
ibuprofen.  she currently smokes small amount of cigarette.  she uses oxygen when it is 
needed at home.  she has chronic shortness of breath, but denies unusual cough or 
hemoptysis.  she does not have gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptomatologies.  she 
denies visual, hearing, or speech impairment.  she denies gait abnormality.

physical examination:
general:  she appears to be in good condition, alert and oriented, in no acute distress.
vital signs:  she weighs 117 pounds, temperature 98.6 fahrenheit, pulse 102, blood 
pressure 126/68, respirations 22, and oxygen saturation 93% at ambient air.
heent:  there is no facial asymmetry.  extraocular movement is normal.
neck:  there is no lymphadenopathy in the neck.
lungs:  showing very limited air movement with scattered wheezing, consistent with copd.
heart:  showing regular rhythm without murmur.
abdomen:  benign.
extremities:  without edema.
neurologic:  unremarkable.  there is mild punch tenderness in the spine.

impression:  margaret umbel is doing well, although she has chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease for which she requires oxygen when it is needed.  today, oxygen saturation is 93% at 
ambient air.  therefore, we encouraged her to see a pulmonologist and home 
oxygenation/continuous oxygen therapy.  we recommended her to return to radiation oncology 
clinic in 6 months for followup examination.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  mr. maiorano is a 68-year-old gentleman presenting for ongoing 
treatment and evaluation of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology.
 
he is currently presenting for cycle 2, day 1 of carboplatin and pemetrexed.
 
oncologic history:  briefly, he was initially diagnosed after having presented with 
progressive shortness of breath at which point in time, a ct scan demonstrated extensive 
thoracic adenopathy, parenchymal lung disease within the right lower lobe and a large right-
sided pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.  biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node 
demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma with mutational testing, which was negative for 
egfr, alk, ros1 and pd-l1.  it was at that point in time that he was recommended for 
initiation of systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed.  he completed whole brain 
radiotherapy to multiple metastatic lesions to the cns at the beginning of march of 2017.
 
interim history:  mr. maiorano returns to the office today for interim followup.  he really 
feels quite well and tolerated his first cycle of chemotherapy really without much by way of 
treatment-related side effects.  he was able to continue all of his day-to-day activities without 
any significant fatigue, decrease in appetite or weight loss.  he is making a conscious effort with 
the help of his son to eat a bit more healthy.  he does complain of his persistent sinus drainage 
which has been a long-term issue in addition to some sensation of fullness in both ears without 
any discrete pain.
 
review of systems:  his comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.
 
physical examination:
vital signs:  demonstrate a temperature of 97.2, his blood pressure is 140/70, pulse rate 71, 
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
general:  he is a caucasian male in no acute distress.
heent:  reveals no scleral icterus.  no oropharyngeal lesions.
neck:  stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring 
up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at this point in time
heart:  regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
lungs:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
abdomen:  nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  no palpable masses.
extremities:  he has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
neurologic:  he is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
skin:  reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
musculoskeletal:  reveals no acute defect.
 
laboratory data:  his white count is 3.0 with an anc of 2.3.  his hemoglobin is 11.3.  his 
platelet count is 252.  his comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits with the 
exception of a borderline glucose of 107.
 
assessment and plan:  mr. maiorano is a 68-year-old gentleman presenting for ongoing 
treatment and evaluation of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology.  
he is currently presenting for cycle 2, day 1 of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed.  
it is notable that he actually tolerated his first cycle really quite well and as such, i would like to 
proceed with his second cycle of therapy today.
 
on physical exam, it does seem as though he has stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of 
the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at 
this point in time.  there is also some shotty lymphadenopathy throughout the fossa, which i 
think is also fairly stable, though perhaps a bit more mobile than on prior occasions.  we will 
proceed with therapy at this point in time and as he seems to have at least stable disease, at 
least on physical exam; we will plan to restage him at the conclusion of 4 cycles of carboplatin 
and pemetrexed or sooner should any issues arise.  it is notable that we did complete molecular 
profiling here, he was noted to be negative for c-met and ret by fish and also negative for 
braf, kras and met mutation by ngs.  alk and egfr were also negative by ngs and pd-
l1 is negative.  we also did send peripheral blood genotype using foundation act and is 
notable only for tp53 mutation.  we will continue therapy at this point it in time.  we will see the 
patient back in 3 weeks' time or sooner should any issues arise.

her-2  negative,  diagnosed  january  2009,  (t1b  n0)  status  post  lumpectomy  and  had 
postoperative xrt.  patient declined hormonal therapy.
 
interval history:  mrs. candis freshwater is seen today in the medical oncology 
office for followup of her history of multiple malignancies.  candis tells me that she has 
been feeling well.  she has not had any hospitalizations or er visits, otherwise has no 
new complaints today.  she has had her ct scan done in august 2022 that showed no 
new findings suspicious for malignancy.
 
medications:  amlodipine, atorvastatin, calcium plus d, plavix.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
past medical history:  history of non-small cell lung carcinoma, history of breast 
cancer, ckd iii
social history:  former smoker, quit smoking in 2006.
 
review of systems:  as above per the hpi.  ms. freshwater denies any chest pain, 
chest pressure.  no headaches or visual disturbances.  no odynophagia or dysphagia.  
no  melena,  hematochezia,  hematemesis,  epistaxis  or  hemoptysis.   no  dysuria  or 
hematuria.  no palpitations.  remainder of review of systems has been obtained and is 
otherwise negative.
 
physical examination: 
general:   ms. freshwater is awake, alert and oriented x3, in no apparent distress.
vital  signs:   weight  144  pounds,  temperature  98.2,  pulse  of  90,  respirations  18, 
blood pressure 140/80.
eyes: conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis. pupils and irides 
are  equal  and  normally  reactive  to  light.  extraocular  movements  are  intact,  without 
sclera icterus.
ears, nose, mouth and throat: nasal mucosa, septum and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear. oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudates.
nodes: there are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular or inguinal 
area.
skin:  no  abnormal  nevi,  ecchymoses,  petechiae,  rashes  or  masses  on  inspection  or 
palpation.
chest: lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
cardiovascular:  auscultation  of  the  heart  reveals  no  murmurs,  gallops  or  rubs. 
carotid arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
abdomen:  no  hepatosplenomegaly,  guarding,  tenderness  or  masses.  bowel  sounds 
are normal.
musculoskeletal:  extremities  show  no  edema,  clubbing,  cyanosis  or  joint 
deformity. no tenderness on percussion of the spine.
neurologic:  no  focal  motor  deficits,  no  cerebellar  deficits,  sensation  intact  to 
vibratory and pinprick sensation. 
 
radiology:   ct  scan  of  the  chest  done  on  august  11,  2022  shows  no  convincing 
evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the chest.  mammogram done from 
august 12, 2022 showed no evidence of malignancy.
 
assessment and plan:  
 
1.   history  of  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  status  post  recurrence.   ms. 
freshwater did have a left upper lobe lobectomy in october 2006 and a right upper lobe 
segmentectomy in 2018. in between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in april 2013 and is status post chemo xrt.  i have reviewed ms. freshwater's 
recent  ct  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   the  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and i am happy with that too. at this point in time, i would recommend once 
a year annual ct scan.  i discussed with ms. freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  ct  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of ms. freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  history of left sided breast carcinoma -- t1b n0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. at this point in time, ms. freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
i have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  i will plan to see ms. freshwater back in 1 year.

assessment and plan:  
 
1.   history  of  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  status  post  recurrence.   ms. 
freshwater did have a left upper lobe lobectomy in october 2006 and a right upper lobe 
segmentectomy in 2018. in between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in april 2013 and is status post chemo xrt.  i have reviewed ms. freshwater's 
recent  ct  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   the  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and i am happy with that too. at this point in time, i would recommend once 
a year annual ct scan.  i discussed with ms. freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  ct  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of ms. freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  history of left sided breast carcinoma -- t1b n0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. at this point in time, ms. freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
i have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  i will plan to see ms. freshwater back in 1 year.

ms.  white  is  a  62  year  old  female  seen  for  a  followup  visit  in  the  office  today.   the 
patient was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lung in july 2021.  
the  stage  of  her  disease  was  t1c  n0  m0.  stereotactic  body  radiation  therapy  was 
recommended to the left upper lung tumor.  the patient received 50 gy in 5 fractions.  
the patient completed treatment on november 17, 2021.
 
the patient states overall she is doing quite well.  she states she was recently admitted 
with pneumonia, but has made a full recovery.  she states after her admission, she quit 
smoking.  she states it has been about three weeks since she quit smoking.  the patient 
reports  an  intermittent  dry  cough.   she  has  no  hemoptysis.   she  has  no  shortness  of 
breath.   she  has  no  chest  pain  or  pain  with  inspiration.   she  has  no  sore  throat  or 
difficulty swallowing.  she has intermittent headaches that resolve with self meditation or 
tylenol as needed.  she states her headaches happen quite infrequently.  she has no 
dizziness or vision change.  she continues to receive dialysis three times a week.  she 
states  her  appetite  is  good  and  she  is  able  to  tolerate  a  regular  diet.   her  review  of 
systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
on  exam,  the  patient's  weight  is  147.8  pounds.   no  cervical  or  clavicular 
lymphadenopathy  was  appreciated.   the  patient's  lungs  are  clear,  but  decreased 
bilaterally.  her heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  the patient had a ct of the chest 
on february 15, 2022. the images were reviewed with the patient and her friend who 
accompanies her to the appointment.  we were able to see the decrease in the size of 
the left upper lobe pulmonary mass as described by the radiologist.
 
the patient is clinically doing well.  we would like to monitor the patient closely.  a ct of 
the chest has been requested in three months.  we will see the patient back in our office 
after the ct to review the results.  she was encouraged to call with any questions or 
concerns she may have.  we remain available to see her sooner if needed. this was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  dr.  schocker  who  was  available  during  the  patient's 
appointment today.

date of visit:      05/03/2021

                                   consultation

reason for followup:  the patient is here for administration of systemic chemotherapy 
as well as continuity of care of lung cancer.

diagnosis:  she was initially diagnosed back in may of 2016 with left lower lobe poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma with a superior segmentectomy measuring about 0.9 cm, but she 
recently was found to have abnormality in the left lung.  evaluation again with confirmed non-
small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, not amenable to surgical resection due to the location 
of the malignancy.

current treatment:  the patient is on concurrent chemoradiations as i agreeable after 
the discussion with the patient.

past medical history:  reviewed.  this is unchanged.

social history:  the patient is a chronic smoker, continues to be actively smoking.  no drug 
use, no alcohol drinking.

family history:  reviewed and unchanged.

current medications:  also were reviewed and updated.

allergies:  reviewed and updated.

review of systems:  the patient does not have any specific complaint today, although she 
complained of being tired and fatigued probably related to the effect of the chemotherapy and 
radiation.  she also complains of some difficulty in swallowing, most likely due to the radiation 
effect on the esophageal wall.  she was given some medication by radiation oncology for that.  
she does not express any concern about soreness in the mouth or any painful swallowing or 
any fever or cough.  the patient denies any dysuria, frequency, or hematuria.  nausea is 
minimal.  the major complaint is retrosternal chest pain during the swallow most likely related to 
esophagitis from radiation.  there was no any diarrhea or constipation.  no dysuria, frequency, 
or hematuria.  appetite is fairly okay and weight is stable.

physical examination:
vital signs:  today, she presented with the following vital signs, temperature 96.5, radial 
pulse rate of 98, blood pressure 123/82.  she weighs 167 pounds, body surface area of 1.9 and 
body mass index of 25.
general:  she is otherwise looking comfortable without any evidence of physical 
cardiopulmonary distress.  she is alert and well oriented to time, place and person.  functional 
assessment ecog of 0.
heent:  normocephalic, anicteric.
neck:  supple and symmetrical.
lungs:  clear to auscultation.
cardiovascular:  normal first and second heart sound.
neurologic:  no focal deficit.  no neuropathy noted.  muscle power normal.
mucocutaneous:  normal.  no mucositis.  no skin rash.
hematologic:  no bruises, ecchymosis or petechiae.

laboratory data:  the last blood test was done last week friday, which shows wbc of 
3.5, hemoglobin then was 12.7 and platelet count of 76.  comprehensive metabolic panel:  
sodium of 135, potassium 5.4 and bun and creatinine of 22 and 1.29 respectively and ast and 
alt were 50 and 21 respectively.

assessment and plan:  mrs. carole gordon is on the last cycles of carboplatin and taxol 
today.  she will proceed despite a low platelet count of 76.  i will monitor platelet count very 
closely and give her transfusion as clinically indicated.  she will proceed with radiation therapy 
in farrell this afternoon.  i discussed with the patient also about the role of immunotherapy post-
concurrent chemoradiation, particularly if there is no evidence of residual disease.  at this point, 
the patient has decided not to pursue any further treatment.  she felt that continued smoking 
would possibly preclude to be on maintenance.  so she declined a maintenance durvalumab at 
this point.  meanwhile, i will continue to watch and monitor closely.  after she is done with the 
radiation, we will schedule for a post-treatment ct scan of the chest in about 6 weeks from now.  
she will continue to have weekly labs until count improved above the danger level.  so 
therefore, we will consider to have blood test done before the end of this week, most likely 
around thursday.

stage:   synchronous  recurrent  stage  ivb  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  iva 
squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
history of present illness:  mr. scott is a 68-year-old male with a synchronous 
diagnosis  of  recurrent  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  iva  locally 
advanced  hypopharynx  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  had  a  prior  history  of  dual  primary 
stage iii non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2018 when he had stage pt3 n1 m0 
invasive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  right  upper  lobe  and  a  second  primary  large  cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma pt1b n0 m0.  he underwent right upper lobe lobectomy with 
an en bloc resection of chest wall ribs 2 and 3, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. at 
that time, he was subsequently followed and no evidence of disease until february of 
2022 when he was noted to have an enlarging right tracheoesophageal groove mass at 
the  thoracic  inlet  with  resulting  horseness.  additional  workup  including  pet/ct  scan 
performed february 10, 2022, noted an fdg avid lesion involving the right lateral aspect 
of  the  hypopharynx,  the  level  of  the  hyoid,  enlarged  right  level  2  and  3  lymph  node 
lesions as well as fdg avid tracheoesophageal groove adenopathy.  right upper lobe 
lung nodule and an fdg avid segment 4b   hepatic lesion measuring 3.2 cm concerning 
for metastatic disease.  additional workup including a ebus and biopsy of the level 2r 
mediastinal node was negative for malignant cells with scant cellularity.  he was referred 
to  ent  and  underwent  a  posterior  pharyngeal  wall  biopsy  of  right  posterior  pharynx 
showing  at  least  superficially  invasive  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  a  selective  neck 
dissection  of  right  level  6  contents  showed  metastatic  carcinoma  and  3  of  6  sampled 
lymph nodes with extranodal extension. lesion in the liver was felt to be too deep for 
biopsy.   mri  brain  was  performed  on  january  27,  2022  and  negative  for  brain 
metastasis,  initiated  on  additional  systemic  therapy  with  pembrolizumab  and 
pemetrexed,  completed  total  of  12  cycles  of  pembrolizumab  and  pralatrexate  and 
underwent  repeat  imaging  via  pet/ct  on  august  26,  2022  which  showed  persistent 
disease within the right piriform sinus and right neck with favorable response within the 
chest.  repeat ct chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis on november 28, 2022, showed a 
complete  response  of  his  head  and  neck  lesions  within  the  chest  with  a  stable  7  mm 
right lower lobe lung nodule and response of the previously documented on biopsy liver 
lesion; however, there was persistent unchanged primary tumor within the right piriform 
sinus  and  unchanged  metastatic  right  level  2,  3  cervical  adenopathy.   his  presenting 
symptom was hoarseness, but he tells me his voice quality is subjectively improved.  he 
has difficulty swallowing pills, but tells me is able to eat a normal diet.  he has no taste 
changes or xerostomia.  he presents in radiation oncology for discussion of palliative 
radiation  treatment  options  related  to  his  head  and  neck  prior  given  the  favorable 
response noted of his recurrent lung cancer.
 
prior radiation therapy:  none.
 
past medical history:  history of cerebrovascular accident, on coumadin. chronic 
ckd, peripheral artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, history of seizure disorder, 
copd, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, microcytic anemia, coronary artery disease.
 
prior  surgical  history:   transmetatarsal  foot  amputation,  embolectomy, 
thrombolectomy,  left  tma,  right  vats  with  lobectomy  and  chest  wall  resection  as  per 
hpi.
 
social history:  half pack per day smoker x40 years.  occasional marijuana use.
 
medications:   cyanocobalamin,  folic  acid,  ondansetron,  amlodipine,  atorvastatin, 
ferrous sulfate, iron, keppra, metoprolol, protonix.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
review of systems:  as per hpi.
heent:  as per hpi.
respiratory: he has never worn oxygen.
 
physical examination:
general:  he is alert and oriented with normal speech and mentation.
 
imaging:   pet/ct  scan  obtained  on  february  of  2022,  august  2022,  and  recent  ct 
imaging  with  contrast  enhancement  from  november  of  2022  were  all  personally 
reviewed with findings as per the hpi.
 
labs:  his last laboratory evaluation was performed on december 1, 2022, showed a 
white count of 9.8, hemoglobin 11.9, platelets 213.  creatinine 1.23.
 
impression and plan:  mr. scott is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (initial  stage  dual  primary  pt3  n1  m0 
adenocarcinoma,  and  pt1  n0  m0  large  cell  neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  status  post 
surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy in 2018, now presenting with recurrent metastatic lung 
cancer  and  second  primary  stage  iva  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  hypopharynx, 
status post palliative systemic therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab.
 
plan:  treatment options were reviewed, and case and findings were discussed with 
dr.  krauze.   given  his  favorable  response  of  his  metastatic  lung  cancer  to 
pembrolizumab  and  pemetrexed;  however,  with  persistence  of  his  head  and  neck 
cancer,  would  favor  consideration  of  palliative  radiotherapy  to  the  head  and  neck  to 
promote  local  control  and  maximize  his  disease-free  survival.   acute  as  well  as  late 
potential  radiation  related  side  effects  were  reviewed.  i  reviewed  the  rationale  for 
favoring short course radiotherapy over 5 fractions to improve his tolerance to treatment.  
all  the  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  his  satisfaction.   he  made  an  informed 
decision  towards  proceeding  with  radiotherapy,  we  will  schedule  him  for  ct  based 
simulation and plan to proceed next 1-2 weeks thereafter accordingly.  radiotherapy to 
be  completed  using  imrt/igrt  technique  to  spare  surrounding  critical  organs  at  risk 
including  spinal  cord,  parotid,  oral  cavity,  uninvolved  pharyngeal  constrictors, 
esophagus, cord.
 
thank you for the opportunity to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.  i 
spent approximately 25-30 minutes in this telephone telemedicine visit, inclusive of time 
reviewing his imaging, extensive medical records relating to his complex cancer, history 
of multiple primary lesions and discussing treatment options with him personally.

this consultation was provided via telephone between the patient and the provider.

and carboplatin.
 
secondary  diagnosis:   cutaneous  t-cell  lymphoma  with  overall  stable  disease.  
the patient is using triamcinolone that was given to her by dermatology.
 
interval history:  roberta gibson is a pleasant 65-year-old female who returns for 
followup.   it  is  noted  that  the  patient  reports  that  her  skin  lesions  overall  have  been 
stable  on  the  use  of  triamcinolone  topical  cream.   otherwise,  her  most  recent  ct 
imaging showed improvement of her lung cancer, which the patient is also very pleased. 
given her fatigue and borderline renal function, we have to stop pemetrexed and only 
continue with single agent pembrolizumab.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
current  medications:   zofran  as  needed,  amlodipine,  ecotrin,  metformin  and 
hydrochlorothiazide.
 
past  medical  history:   type  2  diabetes,  hypertension,  lung  cancer,  ckd  and

principal  diagnosis:   adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  metastases  to  regional 
lymph  nodes,  liver,  adrenal,  ribs,  right  choroid,  initially  partial  vision  loss,  status  post 
radiation.
 
current  therapy:   maintenance  pembrolizumab  previously  also  on  pemetrexed 
and carboplatin.
 
secondary  diagnosis:   cutaneous  t-cell  lymphoma  with  overall  stable  disease.  
the patient is using triamcinolone that was given to her by dermatology.
 
interval history:  roberta gibson is a pleasant 65-year-old female who returns for 
followup.   it  is  noted  that  the  patient  reports  that  her  skin  lesions  overall  have  been 
stable  on  the  use  of  triamcinolone  topical  cream.   otherwise,  her  most  recent  ct 
imaging showed improvement of her lung cancer, which the patient is also very pleased. 
given her fatigue and borderline renal function, we have to stop pemetrexed and only 
continue with single agent pembrolizumab.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
current  medications:   zofran  as  needed,  amlodipine,  ecotrin,  metformin  and 
hydrochlorothiazide.
 
past  medical  history:   type  2  diabetes,  hypertension,  lung  cancer,  ckd  and 
cd30 positive skin proliferation.

laboratory  studies:   creatinine  of  1.63.   white  count  of  8.1,  hemoglobin  of  11, 
platelet count of 216.  albumin of 4.
 
assessment  and  plan:   for  this  65-year-old  female  with  history  of  lung  cancer, 
widely metastatic disease upon diagnosis with actually so far very good response and 
plans  to  continue  pembrolizumab  at  this  point  for  up  to  2  years.   otherwise,  her  skin 
lesions  are  essentially  stable,  if  not  slightly  better.   i  asked  the  patient  to  continue  to 
prescribe medications from dr. akilov from dermatology.  also, if there is any worsening, 
i recommended the patient to see him back.  her other medical problems seemed to be 
fairly stable as is her ckd, diabetes, obesity and hypertension.  we will see her again in 
6 weeks.  the patient will continue her treatment every 3 weeks.

radiographically, only site of disease is right paratracheal lymph node.  the patient has been 
feeling better following discontinuation of docetaxel. 
2.  i discussed the case with radiation oncology (dr. brian karlovits is unavailable, but case 
discussed with dr. david clump).  i will refer her to radiation oncology for possible radiation 
therapy.
3.  we will monitor her off systemic therapy.  at time of disease progression, we can consider

                                    office note

 reason for visit:  followup of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.

history of present illness:  in april 2014, the patient developed hematuria.  she was 
found to have a kidney stone, but also a right lung nodule.  further testing revealed a 3.5 x 5.1 x 
5 cm mediastinal mass as well as a 1.4 cm right upper lobe mass and a 1.9 cm right lower lobe 
mass.  biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.  molecular studies were negative.  pet scan showed 
uptake in the primary tumor as well as left femur adrenal gland.  brain mri was negative.  she 
was treated with taxol, carboplatin and avastin through october 2014, with significant 
improvement.  she declined xgeva.  she then was treated with maintenance avastin through 
july 2015.  at that time, scans revealed new right hilar adenopathy and mediastinal adenopathy 
with near occlusion of the svc.  she received concurrent taxol and radiation followed by 
retreatment with taxol, carboplatin and avastin through november 2015.  at that time, scans 
revealed a new lung nodule and she was treated with alimta, carboplatin, and avastin through 
february 2016 with significant improvement.  she resumed maintenance alimta in march 2016.  
followup scans have been stable.  further testing of her original lung biopsy in 2014 has 
confirmed that her pd-l1 is 30%.  in march 2017, avastin had to be held due to proteinuria.  
repeat urine testing revealed improvement in the proteinuria and she resumed therapy in april 
2017.

review of systems:  ms. kelly comes in today for followup and to get her next avastin 
therapy.  she tells me over the past few weeks, she has continued to have some side effects 
most likely from the avastin.  she continues to have swelling in her ankles.  her urinalysis 
continues to show protein, but her 24-hour urine protein remains under 2000 mg.  she also has 
noted some occasional abdominal cramping.  she denies any severe abdominal pain.  she 
describes the cramps as mild and usually located in her back rather than in the abdomen itself.  
she has had some mild diarrhea.  she denies bleeding from the bowels.  she denies fevers or 
chills.  she denies nausea or vomiting.  she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches 
or dizzy spells.  she has continued sciatic type pain in the back, which is unchanged.  her 
appetite is decreased.  all other systems were reviewed with the patient and her husband and 
are negative.

physical examination:
general:  well-developed, well-nourished white female, in no acute distress.
vital signs:  temperature 98.1, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 154/84, 
and weight 136.7 pounds, which is down 4.4 pounds from her last visit.
heent:  pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  extraocular movements intact.  no scleral 
icterus.  oropharynx moist and pink without tonsillar erythema or exudate.  there is no thrush 
and there are no mouth ulcers.
neck:  no jvd or thyromegaly.
nodes:  no anterior cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy palpable.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
lungs:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
abdomen:  soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or 
masses.
extremities:  there is 1+ edema in the ankles extending up to the mid calf.  there is no 
erythema or calf tenderness.
neurologic:  nonfocal.
skin:  no rash or petechiae.

laboratory data and imaging:  blood work today reveals an unremarkable cbc.  
chemistry panel is also within normal limits.  urinalysis again shows 3+ protein, but 24-hour 
urine protein reveals just over 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours, which is acceptable for avastin 
therapy.  ms. kelly underwent a ct of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on june 12th.  this 
reveals a stable 1.5 cm ground-glass density in the right upper lobe.  the right lower lobe 
nodule is slightly decreased in size or similar in size compared to previous scans.  stable 
fullness is seen around the superior vena cava, but without significant narrowing.  in the 
abdomen, there is no evidence of any new disease.  no evidence of any abnormality in the 
colon is seen concerning for perforation due to avastin.

assessment:  a 75-year-old white female with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.  she is 
currently on maintenance avastin.  she has been on this for about 15 months.  her scans 
continue to show stable disease.  however, she is having some side effects, which i think are 
most likely attributable to the avastin.  these include lower extremity edema probably due to her 
kidney issues and proteinuria.  she also has abdominal cramping, which could be due to the 
avastin as well as she reports that it significantly improved when she was off avastin for a few 
weeks.  however, she continues to have a good response to the treatment without any new 
disease.

plan:  i had a long talk with ms. kelly and her husband today basically about the cat scan 
results and her goals as far as the treatment.  i told her i agree with her it is most likely the 
avastin that is leading to the side effects with the abdominal cramping and almost surely it is the 
avastin that is leading to the fluid overload in the ankles.  i told her we basically have to decide 
if her quality of life is more important to her than treating the cancer itself.  i told her again today 
that she does have an incurable cancer, the avastin is just being given to give her more time, 
but if that medication is leading to a decreased overall quality of life, then we may not be really 
improving her overall picture.  basically, she has to decide if treating the cancer is more 
important to her or having a better quality of life is more important.  i told her if we stop the 
avastin, i would recommend that we scan her again in a few months and if there is evidence of 
disease recurrence, we can always try to put her on opdivo.  right now, she is planning to 
continue the avastin at least today and in 3 weeks.  i will see her again in 6 weeks, but i told her 
if she has problems over the next few weeks just to call my office and tell my nursing staff to 
hold the avastin and we will have this discussion again in about 6 weeks.

noted some occasional abdominal cramping.  she denies any severe abdominal pain.  she 
describes the cramps as mild and usually located in her back rather than in the abdomen itself.  
she has had some mild diarrhea.  she denies bleeding from the bowels.  she denies fevers or 
chills.  she denies nausea or vomiting.  she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches 
or dizzy spells.  she has continued sciatic type pain in the back, which is unchanged.  her 
appetite is decreased.  all other systems were reviewed with the patient and her husband and 
are negative.

physical examination:
general:  well-developed, well-nourished white female, in no acute distress.
vital signs:  temperature 98.1, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 154/84, 
and weight 136.7 pounds, which is down 4.4 pounds from her last visit.
heent:  pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  extraocular movements intact.  no scleral 
icterus.  oropharynx moist and pink without tonsillar erythema or exudate.  there is no thrush 
and there are no mouth ulcers.
neck:  no jvd or thyromegaly.
nodes:  no anterior cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy palpable.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
lungs:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
abdomen:  soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or 
masses.
extremities:  there is 1+ edema in the ankles extending up to the mid calf.  there is no 
erythema or calf tenderness.
neurologic:  nonfocal.
skin:  no rash or petechiae.

laboratory data and imaging:  blood work today reveals an unremarkable cbc.  
chemistry panel is also within normal limits.  urinalysis again shows 3+ protein, but 24-hour 
urine protein reveals just over 1000 mg of protein in 24 hours, which is acceptable for avastin 
therapy.  ms. kelly underwent a ct of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on june 12th.  this 
reveals a stable 1.5 cm ground-glass density in the right upper lobe.  the right lower lobe 
nodule is slightly decreased in size or similar in size compared to previous scans.  stable 
fullness is seen around the superior vena cava, but without significant narrowing.  in the 
abdomen, there is no evidence of any new disease.  no evidence of any abnormality in the 
colon is seen concerning for perforation due to avastin.

assessment:  a 75-year-old white female with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.  she is 
currently on maintenance avastin.  she has been on this for about 15 months.  her scans 
continue to show stable disease.  however, she is having some side effects, which i think are 
most likely attributable to the avastin.  these include lower extremity edema probably due to her 
kidney issues and proteinuria.  she also has abdominal cramping, which could be due to the 
avastin as well as she reports that it significantly improved when she was off avastin for a few 
weeks.  however, she continues to have a good response to the treatment without any new 
disease.

plan:  i had a long talk with ms. kelly and her husband today basically about the cat scan 
results and her goals as far as the treatment.  i told her i agree with her it is most likely the 
avastin that is leading to the side effects with the abdominal cramping and almost surely it is the 
avastin that is leading to the fluid overload in the ankles.  i told her we basically have to decide 
if her quality of life is more important to her than treating the cancer itself.  i told her again today 
that she does have an incurable cancer, the avastin is just being given to give her more time, 
but if that medication is leading to a decreased overall quality of life, then we may not be really 
improving her overall picture.  basically, she has to decide if treating the cancer is more 
important to her or having a better quality of life is more important.  i told her if we stop the 
avastin, i would recommend that we scan her again in a few months and if there is evidence of 
disease recurrence, we can always try to put her on opdivo.  right now, she is planning to 
continue the avastin at least today and in 3 weeks.  i will see her again in 6 weeks, but i told her 
if she has problems over the next few weeks just to call my office and tell my nursing staff to 
hold the avastin and we will have this discussion again in about 6 weeks.

stage:  iv.
 
reason  for  consult:   dr.  burns  referred  the  patient  for  an  opinion  regarding 
radiation therapy for her bra- positive non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
history of present illness:  ms. holt is a 50-year-old with a metastatic braf-
positive  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases  and  bone 
metastases.   she  was  diagnosed  in  august  2019.   she  was  treated  with  systemic 
therapy  including  braf/mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab.   she  has  been  off  therapy  for  over  a  year  without  progression.   she 
received  radiation  therapy  to  l4-sacrum  30  gy  in  september  2019  and  l5-s1  on  the 
right with sbrt to a dose of 24 gy in 3 fractions in july 2020.  she was doing well until 
recently.   she  has  been  having  increasing  left  radicular  sacral  pain.   the  pain  has 
become  fairly  severe.   she  had  an  mri  of  the  spine  on  november  8,  2022,  which 
showed bone metastases to l5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into the left s1-s2 
and s2-s3 neural foramen.  there was a possible small focus of nodular enhancement 
in the left aspect of the thecal sac at the level of l1-l2.  mri of the brain on november 8, 
2022, showed 3 small enhancing lesions consistent with brain metastases including left 
frontal, left parietal and left occipital.  ct on october 19, 2022, showed stable extensive 
sclerotic bone metastases involving the pelvis, t1-l5, sacrum and pelvis.  she was seen 
regarding radiation therapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.

allergies:  no drug allergies.
 
past medical history:  hypothyroidism secondary to immunotherapy.
 
family history:  mother with endometrial cancer and thyroid cancer.
 
social history:  she does not smoke.  drinks alcohol occasionally.
 
review of systems:  she has had increasing radicular sacral pain on the left.  pain 
has been worse with sitting for long periods.  it is better with standing.  she has some 
fatigue.   she  denied  any  focal  weakness,  bowel  or  bladder  problems,  shortness  of 
breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  
she has some chronic paresthesias.  rest of the review of systems was negative.

                                  consultation 

referring physician:  dr. timothy burns.
 
diagnoses: 
1.  brain metastases.
2.  bone metastases.
 
code:  c79.31, c79.51, z92.3.
 
stage:  iv.
 
reason  for  consult:   dr.  burns  referred  the  patient  for  an  opinion  regarding 
radiation therapy for her bra- positive non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
history of present illness:  ms. holt is a 50-year-old with a metastatic braf-
positive  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases  and  bone 
metastases.   she  was  diagnosed  in  august  2019.   she  was  treated  with  systemic 
therapy  including  braf/mek  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab.   she  has  been  off  therapy  for  over  a  year  without  progression.   she 
received  radiation  therapy  to  l4-sacrum  30  gy  in  september  2019  and  l5-s1  on  the 
right with sbrt to a dose of 24 gy in 3 fractions in july 2020.  she was doing well until 
recently.   she  has  been  having  increasing  left  radicular  sacral  pain.   the  pain  has 
become  fairly  severe.   she  had  an  mri  of  the  spine  on  november  8,  2022,  which 
showed bone metastases to l5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into the left s1-s2 
and s2-s3 neural foramen.  there was a possible small focus of nodular enhancement 
in the left aspect of the thecal sac at the level of l1-l2.  mri of the brain on november 8, 
2022, showed 3 small enhancing lesions consistent with brain metastases including left 
frontal, left parietal and left occipital.  ct on october 19, 2022, showed stable extensive 
sclerotic bone metastases involving the pelvis, t1-l5, sacrum and pelvis.  she was seen 
regarding radiation therapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
medications:  tylenol, advil, medrol dosepak, oxycodone, unithroid, vitamins.
 
allergies:  no drug allergies.
 
past medical history:  hypothyroidism secondary to immunotherapy.
 
family history:  mother with endometrial cancer and thyroid cancer.
 
social history:  she does not smoke.  drinks alcohol occasionally.
 
review of systems:  she has had increasing radicular sacral pain on the left.  pain 
has been worse with sitting for long periods.  it is better with standing.  she has some 
fatigue.   she  denied  any  focal  weakness,  bowel  or  bladder  problems,  shortness  of 
breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  
she has some chronic paresthesias.  rest of the review of systems was negative.
 
physical examination:  she was in nad.  pulse 76, respirations 16, blood pressure 
130/80, weight 172 pounds.  eomi.  no icterus.  ent was negative.  lungs were clear.  
heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  abdomen was soft, nontender.  extremities, no 
edema.   neurologic,  cranial  nerves  were  intact.   motor  function  was  5/5.   gait  was 
normal.  there were no areas of bony tenderness.
 
laboratory data:  x-rays were reviewed.  mri of the spine on november 8, 2022, 
showed sclerotic bone metastases involving l5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into 
the left s1-s2 and s2-s3 neural foramen.  there was no high-grade canal compromise.  
there  was  a  small  focus  of  suspected  nodular  enhancement  at  the  left  aspect  of  the 
thecal sac at the level of l1-l2.  mri of the brain showed small enhancing left frontal, 
left parietal and left occipital lesions consistent with brain metastases.
 
assessment and plan:  a 50-year-old with a non-small cell carcinoma of the lung 
with brain and bone metastases.  mri of the brain on november 8, 2022, showed small 
enhancing  left  frontal,  left  parietal  and  left  occipital  lesions  consistent  with  brain 
metastases.  treatment options were discussed.  she was a candidate for stereotactic 
radiosurgery.  risks and benefits of radiosurgery were discussed.  she has left radicular 
sacral  pain.   mri  showed  metastatic  disease  involving  l5  and  the  sacrum  with  likely 
involvement  of  the  left  s1-s2  and  s2-s3  nerve  roots.   there  was  also  a  small  focal 
enhancing lesion in the left aspect of the thecal sac at l1-l2.  treatment options were 
discussed.   the  l5  and  sacrum  have  previously  been  treated  with  external  beam 
radiation therapy and on the right with sbrt.  the left sacrum could be retreated with 
sbrt.   risks  and  benefits  of  sbrt  were  discussed.   she  can  also  receive  external 
beam radiation therapy to l1-l2.
 
total time spent on today's visit was 50 minutes. this included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests  and  time  spent

history of present illness:  this is a 56-year-old asian male who has a known 
diagnosis of stage iv adenocarcinoma of the lung with malignant pleural effusion.  egfr and 
alk, mutation were negative.  he initially received chemotherapy with carboplatin, alimta, and 
avastin.  he had an excellent response.  pet/ct scan in july 2013 showed complete 
remission.  cea came down to 0.8.  he received maintenance treatment with avastin alone.  
his cea level went up to 8.8.  repeat ct scan in january 2014 showed small pleural effusion.  
we restarted chemotherapy with carboplatin, alimta, and avastin in february 2014.  he 
developed skin rash, but it was not related to his chemotherapy.  his cea came down to 1.8.

his cea level continued to rise again.  in march 2016, cea level was 5.3.  ct scan in february 
2016 showed no significant change.  sometimes, ct scans change is proceeded by abnormal 
blood test.  the patient does not want to receive full dose of chemotherapy because of side 
effects.  he was started on new immunotherapies with nivolumab.  he does not have any 
significant side effect.  his cea level came down to 4.4.
 
review of systems:  the patient denies any fever, chills or night sweats.  appetite is good.  
he has some gerd symptoms and was restarted on protonix.  denies any nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematuria, or any other bleeding.  the rest of his 10-point 
review of systems is negative.

history of present illness:  this is a 56-year-old asian male who has a known 
diagnosis of stage iv adenocarcinoma of the lung with malignant pleural effusion.  egfr and 
alk, mutation were negative.  he initially received chemotherapy with carboplatin, alimta, and 
avastin.  he had an excellent response.  pet/ct scan in july 2013 showed complete 
remission.  cea came down to 0.8.  he received maintenance treatment with avastin alone.  
his cea level went up to 8.8.  repeat ct scan in january 2014 showed small pleural effusion.  
we restarted chemotherapy with carboplatin, alimta, and avastin in february 2014.  he 
developed skin rash, but it was not related to his chemotherapy.  his cea came down to 1.8.  
he received maintenance treatment with alimta and avastin without carboplatin every 4 weeks.  
his cea level continued to rise again.  in march 2016, cea level was 5.3.  ct scan in february 
2016 showed no significant change.  sometimes, ct scans change is proceeded by abnormal 
blood test.  the patient does not want to receive full dose of chemotherapy because of side 
effects.  he was started on new immunotherapies with nivolumab.  he does not have any 
significant side effect.  his cea level came down to 4.4.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, alk 
translocation negative, insufficient tissue for egfr, ros-1 and ret.

prior therapy:  please refer to the note from july 2015, for complete details.  ct-guided 
right lower lobe mass biopsy in october 2013 revealed adenocarcinoma.  staging pet scan 
revealed metastatic disease to 12th rib.  he completed srs to the right lower lobe mass and 
right 12th rib in the oligometastatic trial.  he completed adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin 
and alimta for 4 cycles.  pet scan in june 2014 revealed a favorable response.  he received 
maintenance alimta until june 2015 when progression was noted.  he started second line 
therapy with nivolumab, status post 12 doses, last in october 2016.  he received radiation to 
t10, the right flank, right 12th rib, right femur, left flank, and right pelvis in march 2016.  he 
completed 4 cycles of abraxane, 3 on and 1 off with good response, last in june 2016.

current therapy:  maintenance abraxane 100 mg/m2, 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off.  
today will be cycle #4.

interval history:  mr. brown returns to clinic for further management of the above.  
overall, since his last visit, he has been feeling very well.  his weight has improved and appetite 
has improved as well.  he denies any fevers, chills or sweats.  he denies any nausea, vomiting, 
or hematemesis.  he denies any bright red blood per rectum or any melena.  he continues to 
have some mild shortness of breath with exertion, which is stable, if not slightly improved.  
denies any cough or hemoptysis.  denies any headaches, change in vision, or focal 
weaknesses.  he has some chronic pain throughout, especially back, shoulder as well as right 
hip, all of which are controlled on percocet, none of these have worsened.  he does have some 
intermittent neuropathy in his bilateral lower extremities which he feels overall not bothersome.  
he is not tripping, falling or having gait issues.

review of systems:  as per the interval history, otherwise all systems have been reviewed 
and are negative.

physical examination:

general:  this is a well-appearing male in no apparent distress.

vital signs:  temperature is 97.5, pulse 82, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 144/90, pulse 
ox 97% on room air.  he weighs 167 pounds.

heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  pupils equal, round and reactive.  extraocular 
movements are intact.  oropharynx is clear.  sclerae are anicteric.  conjunctivae are pink.

lymphatics:  no palpable adenopathy noted.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally aside from the right lower lobe which is diminished.  no 
wheezes.

cardiovascular:  regular rhythm.  no murmurs.

abdomen:  bowel sounds are present.  soft, nontender.  no hepatosplenomegaly.

extremities:  no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

neurologic:  nonfocal.  he is alert and oriented.

laboratory data:  from today, white blood cell count 5.7, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 
38.4, platelets 204,000, anc 3900.  sodium 142, potassium 3.5, creatinine 1.5, calcium 9.0, 
magnesium 1.1.

radiologic data:  he had a pet/ct scan completed today, october 5, 2016.  pet/ct 
shows stable disease in the right perihilar and paraspinal regions.  right pleural effusion is also 
stable.  skeletal mets in the iliac bone and femoral shaft are also stable if not decreased.  there 
is a focus in the left clavicle, when looking back at prior scans was present, but now slightly 
more avid.  increased activity noted in the right 12th and 8th ribs with increased sclerotic 
changes.  aortocaval lymph node is new measuring 1.1cm in short axis diameter.

impression and plan:

1.  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type.  pet/ct scan from today, which 
dr. petro and i personally reviewed, shows stable disease.  skeletal mets in the ribs and 
clavicle are slightly brighter but appear more sclerotic, likely representing treatment changes.  
there is a new aortocaval lymph node which is fdg avid but only measures 1.1cm and could 
be reactive. the right-sided pleural effusion is stable, if not slightly decreased.  we will continue 
to follow these areas closely.  he will continue maintenance abraxane for two further cycles with 
restaging scans after cycle #5.  today will be the start of cycle #4.  we will continue to follow 
cbc and cmp.

2.  generalized bone pain.  this has not worsened.  he will continue with p.r.n. percocet.  this 
is managed by dr. clump.

3.  electrolytes disturbance.  he will be replaced iv magnesium today.  he will return to our 
clinic in 4 weeks.

patient id#:        000054947
date of birth:      02/12/1949
date of visit:      10/05/2016

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, alk 
translocation negative, insufficient tissue for egfr, ros-1 and ret.

prior therapy:  please refer to the note from july 2015, for complete details.  ct-guided 
right lower lobe mass biopsy in october 2013 revealed adenocarcinoma.  staging pet scan 
revealed metastatic disease to 12th rib.  he completed srs to the right lower lobe mass and 
right 12th rib in the oligometastatic trial.  he completed adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin 
and alimta for 4 cycles.  pet scan in june 2014 revealed a favorable response.  he received 
maintenance alimta until june 2015 when progression was noted.  he started second line 
therapy with nivolumab, status post 12 doses, last in october 2016.  he received radiation to 
t10, the right flank, right 12th rib, right femur, left flank, and right pelvis in march 2016.  he 
completed 4 cycles of abraxane, 3 on and 1 off with good response, last in june 2016.

current therapy:  maintenance abraxane 100 mg/m2, 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off.  
today will be cycle #4.

interval history:  mr. brown returns to clinic for further management of the above.  
overall, since his last visit, he has been feeling very well.  his weight has improved and appetite 
has improved as well.  he denies any fevers, chills or sweats.  he denies any nausea, vomiting, 
or hematemesis.  he denies any bright red blood per rectum or any melena.  he continues to 
have some mild shortness of breath with exertion, which is stable, if not slightly improved.  
denies any cough or hemoptysis.  denies any headaches, change in vision, or focal 
weaknesses.  he has some chronic pain throughout, especially back, shoulder as well as right 
hip, all of which are controlled on percocet, none of these have worsened.  he does have some 
intermittent neuropathy in his bilateral lower extremities which he feels overall not bothersome.  
he is not tripping, falling or having gait issues.

review of systems:  as per the interval history, otherwise all systems have been reviewed 
and are negative.

physical examination:

general:  this is a well-appearing male in no apparent distress.

vital signs:  temperature is 97.5, pulse 82, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 144/90, pulse 
ox 97% on room air.  he weighs 167 pounds.

heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  pupils equal, round and reactive.  extraocular 
movements are intact.  oropharynx is clear.  sclerae are anicteric.  conjunctivae are pink.

lymphatics:  no palpable adenopathy noted.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally aside from the right lower lobe which is diminished.  no 
wheezes.

cardiovascular:  regular rhythm.  no murmurs.

abdomen:  bowel sounds are present.  soft, nontender.  no hepatosplenomegaly.

extremities:  no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

neurologic:  nonfocal.  he is alert and oriented.

laboratory data:  from today, white blood cell count 5.7, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 
38.4, platelets 204,000, anc 3900.  sodium 142, potassium 3.5, creatinine 1.5, calcium 9.0, 
magnesium 1.1.

radiologic data:  he had a pet/ct scan completed today, october 5, 2016.  pet/ct 
shows stable disease in the right perihilar and paraspinal regions.  right pleural effusion is also 
stable.  skeletal mets in the iliac bone and femoral shaft are also stable if not decreased.  there 
is a focus in the left clavicle, when looking back at prior scans was present, but now slightly 
more avid.  increased activity noted in the right 12th and 8th ribs with increased sclerotic 
changes.  aortocaval lymph node is new measuring 1.1cm in short axis diameter.

impression and plan:

1.  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type.  pet/ct scan from today, which 
dr. petro and i personally reviewed, shows stable disease.  skeletal mets in the ribs and 
clavicle are slightly brighter but appear more sclerotic, likely representing treatment changes.  
there is a new aortocaval lymph node which is fdg avid but only measures 1.1cm and could 
be reactive. the right-sided pleural effusion is stable, if not slightly decreased.  we will continue 
to follow these areas closely.  he will continue maintenance abraxane for two further cycles with 
restaging scans after cycle #5.  today will be the start of cycle #4.  we will continue to follow 
cbc and cmp.

2.  generalized bone pain.  this has not worsened.  he will continue with p.r.n. percocet.  this 
is managed by dr. clump.

3.  electrolytes disturbance.  he will be replaced iv magnesium today.  he will return to our 
clinic in 4 weeks.

interval  history:   ms.  smith  is  here  today  for  followup  of  her  history  of 
unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, progressive.  the patient at her last 
visit noted some right-sided rib pain and ct scan done on september 15, 2022, showed 
what appeared to be a new right-sided rib metastasis.  there was an expansile lytic met 
in  the  anterior  6th  rib.   the  mass  did  invade  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing 
multiple hilar structures, which demonstrated re-occlusion of the left superior pulmonary 
vein, though no change in the background pulmonary fibrosis.  the patient in the past 
had been declining chemotherapy.  she has been on keytruda.  the patient discussed 
starting chemotherapy, taxol and carboplatin with dr. lech at her last office visit, and 
she is here today to start her treatment.  she also was seen by radiation oncology and 
is scheduled to have radiation to her rib for pain.  today, the patient stated she tested 
positive  for  covid  2  weeks  ago.   she  called  her  family  physician  and  was  ordered 
antiviral treatment, but she was unable to get the medication as it was unavailable.  she 
still  has  shortness  of  breath,  and  initially,  had  a  cough  productive  of  the  neon  orange 
mucus  and  yellow  mucus.   she  continues  to  have  the  cough,  but  no  further  orange-
colored mucus.  she wears her o2 at 5 liters continuously.  she thinks that she fell twice 
in the past 2 weeks, causing pain to her shoulder, to her hips.  her husband thinks that 
she really did not fall, but somehow tripped or was sleeping and fell to the floor.  she 
takes  oxycontin,  which  makes  her  kind  of  goofy.   she  has  headaches  and  dizziness 
when  she  first  stands  up.   eating  is  better  and  has  no  further  vomiting  as  she  did 
previously.   the  patient  does  get  occasional  sweats.   she  denies  any  bleeding  or 
bruising.

date of visit:    10/24/2022

                                   office note 

diagnoses:
1.  squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung, status post radiation, december 10, 2020.
2.  evidence of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lung via biopsy, december 7, 
2021, pd-l1 of 30%.
 
current therapy:  keytruda x11 doses.
 
interval  history:   ms.  smith  is  here  today  for  followup  of  her  history  of 
unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, progressive.  the patient at her last 
visit noted some right-sided rib pain and ct scan done on september 15, 2022, showed 
what appeared to be a new right-sided rib metastasis.  there was an expansile lytic met 
in  the  anterior  6th  rib.   the  mass  did  invade  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing 
multiple hilar structures, which demonstrated re-occlusion of the left superior pulmonary 
vein, though no change in the background pulmonary fibrosis.  the patient in the past 
had been declining chemotherapy.  she has been on keytruda.  the patient discussed 
starting chemotherapy, taxol and carboplatin with dr. lech at her last office visit, and 
she is here today to start her treatment.  she also was seen by radiation oncology and 
is scheduled to have radiation to her rib for pain.  today, the patient stated she tested 
positive  for  covid  2  weeks  ago.   she  called  her  family  physician  and  was  ordered 
antiviral treatment, but she was unable to get the medication as it was unavailable.  she 
still  has  shortness  of  breath,  and  initially,  had  a  cough  productive  of  the  neon  orange 
mucus  and  yellow  mucus.   she  continues  to  have  the  cough,  but  no  further  orange-
colored mucus.  she wears her o2 at 5 liters continuously.  she thinks that she fell twice 
in the past 2 weeks, causing pain to her shoulder, to her hips.  her husband thinks that 
she really did not fall, but somehow tripped or was sleeping and fell to the floor.  she 
takes  oxycontin,  which  makes  her  kind  of  goofy.   she  has  headaches  and  dizziness 
when  she  first  stands  up.   eating  is  better  and  has  no  further  vomiting  as  she  did 
previously.   the  patient  does  get  occasional  sweats.   she  denies  any  bleeding  or 
bruising.
 
allergies:  erythromycin, adhesive bandage, pine oil, latex.
 
current  medications:   aspirin,  azathioprine,  flovent  inhaler,  humalog,  imuran, 
ipratropium  inhaler,  janumet,  levalbuterol,  lidocaine  patch,  lorazepam,  medical 
marijuana, oxycontin, prednisone, sertraline, spiriva, vitamin b12.
 
social  history:   she  smokes  about  a  pack  of  cigarettes  a  month.   rarely  drinks 
alcohol.
 
review of systems:
central nervous system:  headache and dizziness as noted above.  no loss of 
consciousness, seizure.
heent:  no change in hearing or vision.  no difficulty chewing or swallowing.
cardiovascular:  no chest pain, heaviness, or palpitations.
lungs:  as noted above.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  a 47-year-old caucasian male with stage iv non-small cell lung 
cancer, egfr exon 19 mutant, diagnosed in september 2014 with acquired t790m mutation 
diagnosed since december 2013.
 
current therapy:  maintenance pemetrexed, avastin, presents for cycle 11, patient has 
every 3-4 weeks.
 
previous therapy:  please see my detailed note from may 31, 2016.
 
interval problem:  mr. kemerer returns today to my clinic for further followup and 
surveillance.  since the last visit, he underwent a full treatment, which led to er visit on august 
3rd which was dizziness, right-sided paresthesia.  this was following injection of xgeva.  his 
calcium was noted to be normal.  this was thought to be chemotherapy related side effect.  
denies having any fever or chills.  no chest pain.  all other review of symptoms negative as 
mentioned, otherwise.  he is looking forward to go for a vacation.
 
past medical history, past surgical history, social history, family 
history:  unchanged from august 1, 2016.
 
current medications:  reviewed.
 
physical examination:
general:  middle-aged gentleman for his stated age.
vital signs:  reviewed as per the emr.
heent:  atraumatic, normocephalic.  pupils equal, reactive to light and accommodation.
neck:  supple, with no thyromegaly.
lymphatics:  no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymph nodes palpated.
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
heart:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs or gallop.
abdomen:  soft, nontender and nondistended.  no hepatosplenomegaly.
extremities:  no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
skin:  no rash.
neurologic:  nonfocal.
 
assessment:  a 47-year-old caucasian male with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, stage 
iv with brain metastasis, exon 19 mutant diagnosed in december 2013 with acquired t790m 
mutation, progressed through tarceva.
 
at this point, certainly will continue with alimta, avastin maintenance treatment.  i discussed the 
most recent ct scan.  thankfully, his lung nodules in right upper lobe, middle lobe and lower 
lobe remain stable in the size.  no evidence of new metastasis.  his most recent mri done in 
august 2015 consistent with stable postoperative changes with no evidence of metastasis.
 
plan:
1.  at this point, i had a long discussion with the patient.  we will plan to continue alimta, 
avastin in light of his young age and maintenance.  he is doing phenomenally well on this 
therapy.  in september 2015, he has progressed through tarceva and rociletinib on clinical trial.  
has not explored tegricel option.  certainly, at this point, in light of his stable disease, we will 
continue to use alimta, avastin at every 4 weeks.  at patient's request, we will delay in light of 
his upcoming vacation.
2.  he otherwise will return in 6 weeks for further followup and surveillance.
3.  for bony metastasis, we will try to use xgeva every 8 weeks.  as his tingling and numbness 
is likely related to xgeva, we will continue to have b12 every 8 weeks.
4.  for previous history of pulmonary embolism, he has not been as compliant to lovenox since 
it has been almost 3 years.  hence, we will stop lovenox.  he understands the risk and benefits.
5.  in the event of progression, we will consider guardant360 assay for expression of egfr 
mutation.
 
time spent:  25 minutes, out of 15 minutes in plan, counseling and coordination of care.

lobe remain stable in the size.  no evidence of new metastasis.  his most recent mri done in 
august 2015 consistent with stable postoperative changes with no evidence of metastasis.
 
plan:
1.  at this point, i had a long discussion with the patient.  we will plan to continue alimta, 
avastin in light of his young age and maintenance.  he is doing phenomenally well on this 
therapy.  in september 2015, he has progressed through tarceva and rociletinib on clinical trial.  
has not explored tegricel option.  certainly, at this point, in light of his stable disease, we will 
continue to use alimta, avastin at every 4 weeks.  at patient's request, we will delay in light of 
his upcoming vacation.
2.  he otherwise will return in 6 weeks for further followup and surveillance.
3.  for bony metastasis, we will try to use xgeva every 8 weeks.  as his tingling and numbness 
is likely related to xgeva, we will continue to have b12 every 8 weeks.
4.  for previous history of pulmonary embolism, he has not been as compliant to lovenox since 
it has been almost 3 years.  hence, we will stop lovenox.  he understands the risk and benefits.
5.  in the event of progression, we will consider guardant360 assay for expression of egfr 
mutation.
 
time spent:  25 minutes, out of 15 minutes in plan, counseling and coordination of care.

date of birth:      06/04/1953
date of visit:      06/16/2021

                                   consultation

reason for evaluation:  adenocarcinoma of the lung.
 
history of present illness:  mr. eger is a 68 year old gentleman who was followed for 
a right lung nodule.  in january 2020, the right lung nodule was biopsied under ct guidance.  
the biopsy was nondiagnostic.  after the biopsy, the patient developed a pneumothorax.  a 
pet/ct scan was then performed on april 29, 2020.  the radiologist described a 
hypermetabolic right upper lobe lung nodule.  the patient was then seen by dr. ryan levy.  on 
may 26, 2020, dr. ryan levy performed a flexible bronchoscopy and a robotic-assisted 
navigational bronchoscopy with biopsy of the right upper lobe.  the biopsy was nondiagnostic.  
the patient states although surgery was reviewed with him, he was not a surgical candidate.  
therefore, he was referred to dr. alex chen.  stereotactic radiation therapy was recommended 
to the right upper lobe nodule.  the patient received 48 gy in 4 fractions.  the patient received 
his last treatment on january 19, 2021.
 
on a followup ct of the chest on may 12, 2021, the radiologist described enlarged mediastinal 
lymph nodes.  dr. michael zlupko performed a bronchoscopy and ebus on may 24, 2021.  a 
biopsy from a 4r lymph node was positive for malignancy, favoring adenocarcinoma.  the 
patient then had a pet/ct scan performed on june 8, 2021.  the radiologist described a 
decrease in the size of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.  multiple new hypermetabolic 
upper mediastinal lymph nodes and a right hilar lymph node were seen consistent with 
metastatic disease.  dr. ryan zlupko referred the patient to our office.  the patient was also 
referred to dr. mohammad alkayem.  the patient was seen by dr. alkayem on june 14, 2021, 
and to complete the patient's staging, imaging of his head was requested.  dr. alkayem 
tentatively recommended concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by 
immunotherapy.
 
the patient states he has an intermittent dry cough.  he reports no hemoptysis.  he states he 
has shortness of breath with exertion.  he has no chest pain or pain with inspiration.  he has a 
history of smoking a half a pack of cigarettes a day for 52 years.  he states he quit smoking 
roughly 3 years ago.  the patient states he has lost 5 to 10 pounds since the beginning of the 
year.  he states his appetite is fair.  he is able to tolerate a regular diet.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
medications:  atorvastatin, omeprazole, furosemide, hydrocodone/acetaminophen, 
carvedilol, aspirin, anoro ellipta, entresto and eliquis.
 
past medical history:  atrial fibrillation, asthma, history of basal cell carcinoma of the 
skin, history of bladder cancer, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney 
disease, copd, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, history of acute 
myocardial infarction, pneumothorax in january 2020, sleep apnea, history of squamous cell 
carcinoma of skin, history of tia and cva.
 
past surgical history:  abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, bronchoscopy with ebus, 
may 24, 2021, coronary stents, ct-guided right upper lobe nodule january 12, 2020, flexible 
navigational bronchoscopy, biopsy of right upper lobe, biopsy on may 26, 2020, excision of 
basal cell carcinomas of the skin, pacemaker and defibrillator  placement, and transurethral 
resection of the bladder tumor.
 
social history:  the patient has a history of smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day for 52 
years.  he states he quit smoking 3 years ago.  he reports no history of alcohol use.  he is 
retired.  he previously worked doing maintenance.  he lives in his own home by himself.
 
family history:  the patient states he has one daughter and two sons, all in good health.  
the patient's brother had a history of malignancies, but he is unsure of the details associated 
with the diagnosis.  he states his sister had breast cancer.
 
review of systems:
general:  the patient states his appetite is fair.  he has lost 5-10 pounds since the beginning 
of treatment.  he has some fatigue, but no generalized weakness, fever, chills, night sweats, or 
hot flashes.
skin:  the patient states he has several dermatologic lesions and follows with a dermatologist.  
he has a history of squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma of the skin.  he has had 
several skin lesions excised in the past.
neck:  no swelling, stiffness, pain, or lymphadenopathy.

hematemesis.  the patient states he had a colonoscopy in roughly 2017.
genitourinary:  no frequency, urgency, hesitancy, incontinence, hematuria, or dysuria.
musculoskeletal:  the patient states he has chronic low back pain, but reports no change 
in his pain.  he reports no other localized or severe skeletal discomfort.  he states he has full 
range of motion of his upper and lower extremities.
neurologic:  he states he had a stroke with residual left-sided facial droop.  he reports no 
other neurologic symptoms.
 
physical examination:
general statement:  this is a 68 year old gentleman alone in the exam room today.
vital signs:  pulse is 72 and regular.  respirations are 20 and unlabored.  blood pressure is 
118/81.  height is 72 inches.  weight is 251 pounds.
skin:  color and turgor are normal.  the patient has several skin lesions on his arms.  he 
follows with his dermatologist regularly.
heent:  pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  sclerae are white, and 
conjunctivae are pink bilaterally.  eoms are intact without nystagmus or lid lag.  the patient's 
speech is clear, without hoarseness.
neck:  straight and symmetrical without cervical or clavicular lymphadenopathy.
lungs:  respirations are 20 and unlabored.  the patient has full and symmetrical chest 
expansion throughout.  the patient's breath sounds are diminished bilaterally, but no 
adventitious breath sounds are appreciated.
cardiac:  regular rate and rhythm.  pulses are within normal limits in the upper and lower 
extremities.  he has no lower extremity edema.
musculoskeletal:  the patient has full range of motion of extremities.  strength is equal in 
the upper and lower extremities.
neurologic:  the patient is alert and well oriented.  he is cooperative and in a pleasant 
mood.  the patient's gait is normal and he is able to ambulate without assistance.  no obvious 
neurologic deficits.
 
review of imaging studies:  we had the opportunity to review the patient's pet/ct scan.  
as noted by the radiologist, the previously treated right upper lung nodule has decreased in size 
and metabolic activity.  we were able to see the fdg-avid lymph nodes in the bilateral upper 
mediastinum, and right hilar region.  specifically, the patient had positive lymph nodes in levels 
2l, 6, 4r and 10r.
 
impression:  recurrent adenocarcinoma of the lung, now with bilateral mediastinal disease 
and right hilar nodal disease.
 
discussion and recommendation:  the situation was reviewed in detail today with the 
patient in an office visit lasting about 1-1/2 hours in time.  we reviewed the patient's history and 
his previous treatment using stereotactic radiation therapy.  we spent time reviewing the 
pathology from the patient's recent bronchoscopy and ebus.  time was also spent reviewing 
the patient's pet/ct scan.  concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been 
recommended.  the nature and details of radiation therapy, including the short and long-term 
side effects associated with treatment were reviewed with the patient.  the patient had the 
opportunity to ask questions, and he would like to proceed forward with radiation therapy.  the 
patient will return to our office in the near future for treatment planning.  the patient will receive 
iv contrast for his simulation.  we have encouraged the patient to call with any questions or 
concerns he may have.  this was discussed and agreed upon with dr. schocker who saw and 
examined the patient in the office today.
 
end of dictated report by pa-c.  attending md comment below.

i have personally spoken with the patient, reviewed today's pa-c's progress note for this patient 
and agree with the findings as documented.  i reviewed the history, and examined the patient 
including lungs and lymphatics. i also reviewed multiple imaging studies, including the recent 
pet/ct exam. the positive lymph nodes were noted, as described above and in the official 
report. with no distant metastasis, it seems reasonable to now offer definitive treatment with 
radiation therapy and chemotherapy. radiation treatment will be given to the mediastinum, to a 
field that includes all of the positive lymph nodes visible on the imaging studies. with intensity 
modulated techniques, the plan will be to give 60 gy in six weeks. treatment planning will start 
in the near future.

primary diagnosis:  malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus or lungs.

principal diagnosis:  santo mascellino is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic 
non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with an underlying egfr exon 19 deletion mutation, 
currently on afatinib 30 mg once daily since june 12, 2015.

current therapy:  as above.  the patient currently presenting for his 3-month followup 
visit with the ct scan.

interim history:  mr. mascellino has been well since his prior visit in july 2016.  notably, he 
reports that his last big episode of epistaxis was on october 27, which required extensive 
application of pressure to the nose to stop.  did not require ed visit or hospitalization.  since 
then, repeat episodes of epistaxis have only occurred once weekly and have been very light.  
the patient and his wife also reports that he is recovering from a viral illness, which primarily 
manifested as fatigue, sore throat, and increased number of bowel movements over a 3-4 day 
period.  mr. mascellino is now currently feeling back to baseline, with the exception of some 
residual fatigue.  he wonders if he should get a shingles vaccine at the recommendation of his 
pcp.

review of systems:  notable for continued heartburn, for which the patient is now taking 
zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. as well as tums.  reports that heartburn is fairly well controlled under 
this regimen.  remainder of comprehensive review of systems is negative except for flushing; in 
particular denies fever, chills, headache, vision changes, pain with swallowing, chest pain, 
palpitations, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, polyuria, 
diarrhea, lower extremity swelling or pain, and skin changes.

pulmonary:  ctab over posterior lung fields, no crackles or wheezes.

abdomen:  positive bowel sounds.  soft, nontender, nondistended.

extremities:  warm and well perfused x4, no pretibial edema.

musculoskeletal:  no bony abnormalities, full range of motion in all extremities.

neurologic:  cranial nerves ii through xii intact.  no focal neurologic deficits, normal gait.

laboratory data:  sodium 134, potassium 3.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 28.7, bun 20, 
creatinine 0.9, glucose 95.  calcium, magnesium, phosphorus all within normal limits.  wbcs 
4.9, hemoglobin 13.4, platelets 193.  ldh 154.

radiology:  ct chest from today shows no change in periaortic soft tissue of the descending 
thoracic aorta since february 2016, no change in 6 mm ground-glass left upper lobe nodule 
since february 2016, and no change in rounded atelectasis in the left lower lobe and small 
loculated left pleural effusion.  nothing to suggest disease progression.  

assessment and plan:  santo mascellino is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic 
non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with underlying egfr exon 19 deletion mutation, currently 
on afatinib 30 mg once daily since june 12, 2015.  the patient continues to tolerate this therapy 
well with all laboratory results within normal limits, and repeat ct chest showing stable disease 
today.  we reviewed his imaging results and laboratory results with the patient and his wife 
today, and we recommend that he continue with afatinib at 30 mg daily.  we will continue to 
monitor side effects, including epistaxis and heartburn.  mr. mascellino is to return to clinic in 3 
months with a followup ct scan.

end of dictated report by resident/fellow.  attending md comment

                                    office note

primary diagnosis:  malignant neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus or lungs.

principal diagnosis:  santo mascellino is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic 
non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with an underlying egfr exon 19 deletion mutation, 
currently on afatinib 30 mg once daily since june 12, 2015.

current therapy:  as above.  the patient currently presenting for his 3-month followup 
visit with the ct scan.

interim history:  mr. mascellino has been well since his prior visit in july 2016.  notably, he 
reports that his last big episode of epistaxis was on october 27, which required extensive 
application of pressure to the nose to stop.  did not require ed visit or hospitalization.  since 
then, repeat episodes of epistaxis have only occurred once weekly and have been very light.  
the patient and his wife also reports that he is recovering from a viral illness, which primarily 
manifested as fatigue, sore throat, and increased number of bowel movements over a 3-4 day 
period.  mr. mascellino is now currently feeling back to baseline, with the exception of some 
residual fatigue.  he wonders if he should get a shingles vaccine at the recommendation of his 
pcp.

review of systems:  notable for continued heartburn, for which the patient is now taking 
zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. as well as tums.  reports that heartburn is fairly well controlled under 
this regimen.  remainder of comprehensive review of systems is negative except for flushing; in 
particular denies fever, chills, headache, vision changes, pain with swallowing, chest pain, 
palpitations, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, polyuria, 
diarrhea, lower extremity swelling or pain, and skin changes.  

medications:  cetirizine, fluticasone propionate, zantac, multivitamin, b12, folate, hair and 
nails gummies.

physical examination:

vital signs:  temperature is 97.7, pulse 65, respirations 16, saturating 99% on room air.  
blood pressure 116/59.  height is 65.5 inches, weight is 179.5 pounds.

general:  alert, oriented, pleasant, in no acute distress.

heent:  pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, eom intact.  good 
dentition.  moist mucous membranes.  oropharynx without erythema or exudates.  no thrush.

neck:  no lymphadenopathy.

cv:  regular rate and rhythm, normal s1, s2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
pulmonary:  ctab over posterior lung fields, no crackles or wheezes.

abdomen:  positive bowel sounds.  soft, nontender, nondistended.

extremities:  warm and well perfused x4, no pretibial edema.

musculoskeletal:  no bony abnormalities, full range of motion in all extremities.

neurologic:  cranial nerves ii through xii intact.  no focal neurologic deficits, normal gait.

skin:  no jaundice, no rash.

laboratory data:  sodium 134, potassium 3.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 28.7, bun 20, 
creatinine 0.9, glucose 95.  calcium, magnesium, phosphorus all within normal limits.  wbcs 
4.9, hemoglobin 13.4, platelets 193.  ldh 154.

radiology:  ct chest from today shows no change in periaortic soft tissue of the descending 
thoracic aorta since february 2016, no change in 6 mm ground-glass left upper lobe nodule 
since february 2016, and no change in rounded atelectasis in the left lower lobe and small 
loculated left pleural effusion.  nothing to suggest disease progression.  

assessment and plan:  santo mascellino is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic 
non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with underlying egfr exon 19 deletion mutation, currently 
on afatinib 30 mg once daily since june 12, 2015.  the patient continues to tolerate this therapy 
well with all laboratory results within normal limits, and repeat ct chest showing stable disease 
today.  we reviewed his imaging results and laboratory results with the patient and his wife 
today, and we recommend that he continue with afatinib at 30 mg daily.  we will continue to 
monitor side effects, including epistaxis and heartburn.  mr. mascellino is to return to clinic in 3 
months with a followup ct scan.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with contralateral lung 
involvement, adenocarcinoma type, kras mutation positive, diagnosed on a preoperative chest 
x-ray in december 2013.  progression of disease noted in november 2014.  at that time, repeat 
biopsy showed adenocarcinoma and kras mutation was negative. 
  
prior therapy:  please refer to the note from february 2015, for complete details.  previous 
treatments included carboplatin, taxol, and avastin, last in may 2014.  she received 
maintenance avastin until november 2014 when she was noted to have progression of disease.  
new brain lesions were noted in december 2015 in the work up of neurologic symptoms.  she 
received srs to 5 lesions in january 2016.  
  
current therapy:   
1. alimta 500 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks.  her last dose was on january 20th with dr. dai at 
uniontown cancer center. 
2.  srs to new frontal lobe metastasis; on hold until performance status improves.   
3. decadron taper.
 
interval history:  ms. grooms returns to clinic for further management of the above.  
unfortunately, she presented to the hospital in december 2015 with new brain lesions.  these 
lesions were treated with srs in january 2016.  however, she developed new neurologic 
symptoms including left-sided weakness and was admitted to the hospital again at the end of 
january.  at that time, she was found to have severe vasogenic edema due to her recent srs 
treatments as well as a new left frontal lobe metastasis that has yet to be treated due to 
declining performance status.  while inpatient, she was also noted to have a right upper lobe 
pneumonia, which was subsequently treated with iv antibiotics.  she was discharged initially to 
the tcu and has now been discharged to a skilled nursing facility where she has been 
continuing  rehab on a daily basis.  the patient states she continues to have a good outlook but 
her left sided weakness continues to be significant.  she is working with pt and ot multiple 
times a day, but is not yet able to walk on her own.  she requires assistance of 2-3 people to get 
to the bathroom as well as with minimal daily activities.  she denies any fevers, chills or sweats.  
she denies any change in appetite or weight loss.  she denies any nausea, vomiting, or 
hematemesis.  she denies any bright red blood per rectum or any melena.  she does have 
some shortness of breath with exertion, but overall states this is stable.  she denies any cough 
or hemoptysis.  she denies any headaches, change in vision, or focal weaknesses.  she denies 
any new bone pain or back pain.  she does note some irritation to her skin underneath her 
abdomen, at the nursing home, she is using powder on this area to help prevent skin 
breakdown.  she denies any numbness or tingling in her extremities.  she does note continued 
weakness along her left side, especially in her left lower extremity. 
  
review of systems:  as per the interval history, otherwise all systems have been reviewed 
and are negative. 
  
physical examination: 
general:  this is an elderly female in no apparent distress. 
vital signs:  temperature is 97.9, pulse 76, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 122/72, pulse 
ox 98% on room air.  she is unable to be weighed. 
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  extraocular 
movements are intact.  oropharynx is clear.  sclerae are anicteric.  conjunctivae are pink. 
lymphatics:  no palpable adenopathy noted. 
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheezes. 
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs. 
abdomen:  bowel sounds are present.  soft, nontender.  no hepatosplenomegaly. 
extremities:  no cyanosis or clubbing.  she has some trace edema in the left lower 
extremity, which is soft.  pulses are 2+ throughout. 
neurologic:  she is alert and oriented.  she has left-sided weakness.  the left upper 
extremity strength is 4/5, left lower extremity strength is 3/5.  right-sided strength extremity, 
both upper and lower is 5/5.  sensation is intact throughout.
skin: grossly intact.  she has some areas of excoriation under the abdomen. 
  
laboratory data:  from today shows a white blood cell count 10.6, hemoglobin 9.4, 
hematocrit 27.7, platelets 109,000, anc 8700.  sodium 138, potassium 3.5, bun 32, creatinine 
0.6, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.8. 
  
radiologic data:  she had a ct of the chest and abdomen completed today, february 25, 
2016.  ct shows the mass in the right upper lobe, the left upper lobe nodule and the superior 
segment left lower lobe mass are all unchanged in size when compared to scans from 
december 2015.  there is a new peripheral nodule measuring 2.8 cm with central cavitation 
related to her recent pneumonia, which is resolving.  all lymph nodes are less than 1 cm and 
short axis diameter and there is no evidence of any new metastases in the abdomen or skeletal 
system. 
  
impression and plan: 
1.  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, kras mutation positive.  
unfortunately, ms. grooms' recent performance status has recently declined due to the 
progression of disease in the brain.  she had significant vasogenic edema related to the recent 
stereotactic radiosurgery treatments causing a continued decline in performance.  last dose of 
maintenance alimta was on january 20th.  ct scans from today, which dr. petro and i 
personally reviewed, show stable disease.  the posterior right upper lobe mass, left lower lobe 
mass and left upper lobe nodule are all stable in size.  she has a new right upper lobe nodule 
which is cavitary; likely related to her resolving pneumonia.  we would like to repeat ct scans in 
3 months.  we recommend to hold any further maintenance alimta until performance status 
improves.  she does need treatment to the new left frontal lobe lesion that was noted on mri 
during recent hospital admission.  radiation oncology is waiting until neurologic symptoms 
improve before continuing with further radiation. we have encouraged continued pt and ot on 
a daily basis to help improve her strength and performance status.  she will continue to follow 
very closely with dr. dai.  
2.  right upper lobe pneumonia.  this looks to be resolving on ct scans today.  she does not 
have any current infectious symptoms and white blood cell count is normal.   
3.  left-sided weakness secondary to vasogenic edema. this will hopefully improve with 
continued pt and ot.  she has continued to dexamethasone for vasogenic edema.  she was 
given weaning parameters today.  she will return to our clinic in 4 weeks to ensure continued 
improvement. 
end of dictated report by crnp.  attending md comment below. 
  
i have personally spoken with the patient, reviewed today's crnp's progress note for this 
patient and agree with the findings as documented.  today the key element(s) of service that i 
personally provided are as follows:  ct scans today revealed stable disease.  resolving 
pneumonia in rll.  i personally reviewed these scans.  hold chemo and srs to new left fronts 
lesion until ps improves.  continue decahedron taper.

segment left lower lobe mass are all unchanged in size when compared to scans from 
december 2015.  there is a new peripheral nodule measuring 2.8 cm with central cavitation 
related to her recent pneumonia, which is resolving.  all lymph nodes are less than 1 cm and 
short axis diameter and there is no evidence of any new metastases in the abdomen or skeletal 
system. 
  
impression and plan: 
1.  metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, kras mutation positive.  
unfortunately, ms. grooms' recent performance status has recently declined due to the 
progression of disease in the brain.  she had significant vasogenic edema related to the recent 
stereotactic radiosurgery treatments causing a continued decline in performance.  last dose of 
maintenance alimta was on january 20th.  ct scans from today, which dr. petro and i 
personally reviewed, show stable disease.  the posterior right upper lobe mass, left lower lobe 
mass and left upper lobe nodule are all stable in size.  she has a new right upper lobe nodule 
which is cavitary; likely related to her resolving pneumonia.  we would like to repeat ct scans in 
3 months.  we recommend to hold any further maintenance alimta until performance status 
improves.  she does need treatment to the new left frontal lobe lesion that was noted on mri 
during recent hospital admission.  radiation oncology is waiting until neurologic symptoms 
improve before continuing with further radiation. we have encouraged continued pt and ot on 
a daily basis to help improve her strength and performance status.  she will continue to follow 
very closely with dr. dai.  
2.  right upper lobe pneumonia.  this looks to be resolving on ct scans today.  she does not 
have any current infectious symptoms and white blood cell count is normal.   
3.  left-sided weakness secondary to vasogenic edema. this will hopefully improve with 
continued pt and ot.  she has continued to dexamethasone for vasogenic edema.  she was 
given weaning parameters today.  she will return to our clinic in 4 weeks to ensure continued 
improvement. 
end of dictated report by crnp.  attending md comment below. 
  
i have personally spoken with the patient, reviewed today's crnp's progress note for this 
patient and agree with the findings as documented.  today the key element(s) of service that i 
personally provided are as follows:  ct scans today revealed stable disease.  resolving 
pneumonia in rll.  i personally reviewed these scans.  hold chemo and srs to new left fronts 
lesion until ps improves.  continue decahedron taper.

                                    office note

principal diagnosis:  metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with contralateral lung 
involvement, adenocarcinoma type, kras mutation positive, diagnosed on a preoperative chest 
x-ray in december 2013.  progression of disease noted in november 2014.  at that time, repeat 
biopsy showed adenocarcinoma and kras mutation was negative. 
  
prior therapy:  please refer to the note from february 2015, for complete details.  previous 
treatments included carboplatin, taxol, and avastin, last in may 2014.  she received 
maintenance avastin until november 2014 when she was noted to have progression of disease.  
new brain lesions were noted in december 2015 in the work up of neurologic symptoms.  she 
received srs to 5 lesions in january 2016.  
  
current therapy:   
1. alimta 500 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks.  her last dose was on january 20th with dr. dai at 
uniontown cancer center. 
2.  srs to new frontal lobe metastasis; on hold until performance status improves.   
3. decadron taper.
 
interval history:  ms. grooms returns to clinic for further management of the above.  
unfortunately, she presented to the hospital in december 2015 with new brain lesions.  these 
lesions were treated with srs in january 2016.  however, she developed new neurologic 
symptoms including left-sided weakness and was admitted to the hospital again at the end of 
january.  at that time, she was found to have severe vasogenic edema due to her recent srs 
treatments as well as a new left frontal lobe metastasis that has yet to be treated due to 
declining performance status.  while inpatient, she was also noted to have a right upper lobe 
pneumonia, which was subsequently treated with iv antibiotics.  she was discharged initially to 
the tcu and has now been discharged to a skilled nursing facility where she has been 
continuing  rehab on a daily basis.  the patient states she continues to have a good outlook but 
her left sided weakness continues to be significant.  she is working with pt and ot multiple 
times a day, but is not yet able to walk on her own.  she requires assistance of 2-3 people to get 
to the bathroom as well as with minimal daily activities.  she denies any fevers, chills or sweats.  
she denies any change in appetite or weight loss.  she denies any nausea, vomiting, or 
hematemesis.  she denies any bright red blood per rectum or any melena.  she does have 
some shortness of breath with exertion, but overall states this is stable.  she denies any cough 
or hemoptysis.  she denies any headaches, change in vision, or focal weaknesses.  she denies 
any new bone pain or back pain.  she does note some irritation to her skin underneath her 
abdomen, at the nursing home, she is using powder on this area to help prevent skin 
breakdown.  she denies any numbness or tingling in her extremities.  she does note continued 
weakness along her left side, especially in her left lower extremity. 
  
review of systems:  as per the interval history, otherwise all systems have been reviewed 
and are negative. 
  
physical examination: 
general:  this is an elderly female in no apparent distress. 
vital signs:  temperature is 97.9, pulse 76, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 122/72, pulse 
ox 98% on room air.  she is unable to be weighed. 
heent:  normocephalic, atraumatic.  pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  extraocular 
movements are intact.  oropharynx is clear.  sclerae are anicteric.  conjunctivae are pink. 
lymphatics:  no palpable adenopathy noted. 
chest:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  no wheezes. 
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs. 
abdomen:  bowel sounds are present.  soft, nontender.  no hepatosplenomegaly. 
extremities:  no cyanosis or clubbing.  she has some trace edema in the left lower 
extremity, which is soft.  pulses are 2+ throughout. 
neurologic:  she is alert and oriented.  she has left-sided weakness.  the left upper 
extremity strength is 4/5, left lower extremity strength is 3/5.  right-sided strength extremity, 
both upper and lower is 5/5.  sensation is intact throughout.
skin: grossly intact.  she has some areas of excoriation under the abdomen. 
  
laboratory data:  from today shows a white blood cell count 10.6, hemoglobin 9.4, 
hematocrit 27.7, platelets 109,000, anc 8700.  sodium 138, potassium 3.5, bun 32, creatinine 
0.6, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.8.

taxotere  as  fourth-line  therapy.   unfortunately,  he  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  from 
november  23rd  to  november  29th  with  intractable  pain  in  the  left  groin.   ct  of  the 
abdomen  and  pelvis  showed  retroperitoneal  and  right  inguinal  lymphadenopathy.   he 
was seen by palliative care, and he is on ms contin as well as oxycodone p.r.n., his pain 
has been much better controlled since his hospitalization. his appetite is marginal.  his 
energy level is marginal.  he has occasional cough.  he has occasional nausea.  he has

involvement  and  skeletal  metastases,  pd-l1  negative,  no  actionable  mutations 
identified.   he  is  on  fourth-line  taxotere,  status  post  1  cycle.   he  has  declined 
significantly over the course of the past month, and he was admitted for intractable left 
groin pain at the end of november.  he is now on ms contin and oxycodone, which he 
will  continue,  and  he  will  follow  up  with  palliative  care  regarding  his  symptom 
management.  he is dnr/dni.  he would like to receive at least one additional cycle of 
taxotere, even though he understands that clinically he has declined and it is unlikely 
that he is responding particularly well to this chemotherapy regimen.  we will plan for 
repeat  ct  of  the  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis  in  3  weeks.   we  will  obtain  a  cbc  and 
complete metabolic profile today.  he will continue on eliquis for his history of portal vein 
thrombosis  and  atrial  fibrillation.   we  will  continue  with  intensive  monitoring  on  this 
therapy for his life-threatening illness.  i will plan for repeat ct of the chest, abdomen 
and  pelvis  in  3  weeks.   if  this  shows  evidence  of  disease  progression,  we  would 
recommend  hospice  care.   he  understands  this  and  understands  that  there  are  no 
additional treatment options available for him if he has progression on this regimen.  his 
wife  is  his  medical  power  of  attorney.   he  will  contact  our  office  for  any  questions  or 
concerns in the interim.

chemotherapy if possible and we will start him on taxotere in one week.  we discussed 
potential  toxicities  of  taxotere  and  he  is  agreeable  to  proceed.   we  will  administer 
growth factor support with taxotere.  he understands that his chemotherapy options are 
limited at this point, and we also discussed hospice care if he does not tolerate taxotere 
or if he has evidence of disease progression on this therapy, and he will consider this.  
we will obtain a cbc and complete metabolic profile today.  he will continue on eliquis 
for his history of atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease and portal vein thrombosis.  
he  will  return to clinic in 4 weeks for reevaluation.  i will continue on  zometa every  3 
months.   we  will  continue  with  intensive  monitoring  on  this  therapy  for  his  life-
threatening illness.  he is dnr/dni.  his wife is his medical power of attorney.

postoperative xrt.  patient declined hormonal therapy.
 
interval history:  mrs. candis freshwater is seen today in the medical oncology 
office for followup of her history of multiple malignancies.  candis tells me that she has 
been feeling well.  she has not had any hospitalizations or er visits, otherwise has no 
new complaints today.  she has had her ct scan done in august 2022 that showed no 
new findings suspicious for malignancy.
 
medications:  amlodipine, atorvastatin, calcium plus d, plavix.
 
allergies:  no known drug allergies.
 
past medical history:  history of non-small cell lung carcinoma, history of breast 
cancer, ckd iii
social history:  former smoker, quit smoking in 2006.
 
review of systems:  as above per the hpi.  ms. freshwater denies any chest pain, 
chest pressure.  no headaches or visual disturbances.  no odynophagia or dysphagia.  
no  melena,  hematochezia,  hematemesis,  epistaxis  or  hemoptysis.   no  dysuria  or

physical examination: 
general:   ms. freshwater is awake, alert and oriented x3, in no apparent distress.
vital  signs:   weight  144  pounds,  temperature  98.2,  pulse  of  90,  respirations  18, 
blood pressure 140/80.
eyes: conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis. pupils and irides 
are  equal  and  normally  reactive  to  light.  extraocular  movements  are  intact,  without 
sclera icterus.
ears, nose, mouth and throat: nasal mucosa, septum and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear. oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudates.
nodes: there are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular or inguinal 
area.
skin:  no  abnormal  nevi,  ecchymoses,  petechiae,  rashes  or  masses  on  inspection  or 
palpation.
chest: lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
cardiovascular:  auscultation  of  the  heart  reveals  no  murmurs,  gallops  or  rubs. 
carotid arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
abdomen:  no  hepatosplenomegaly,  guarding,  tenderness  or  masses.  bowel  sounds 
are normal.
musculoskeletal:  extremities  show  no  edema,  clubbing,  cyanosis  or  joint 
deformity. no tenderness on percussion of the spine.
neurologic:  no  focal  motor  deficits,  no  cerebellar  deficits,  sensation  intact  to 
vibratory and pinprick sensation. 
 
radiology:   ct  scan  of  the  chest  done  on  august  11,  2022  shows  no  convincing 
evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the chest.  mammogram done from 
august 12, 2022 showed no evidence of malignancy.
 
assessment and plan:  
 
1.   history  of  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  status  post  recurrence.   ms. 
freshwater did have a left upper lobe lobectomy in october 2006 and a right upper lobe 
segmentectomy in 2018. in between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in april 2013 and is status post chemo xrt.  i have reviewed ms. freshwater's 
recent  ct  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   the  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and i am happy with that too. at this point in time, i would recommend once 
a year annual ct scan.  i discussed with ms. freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  ct  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of ms. freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  history of left sided breast carcinoma -- t1b n0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. at this point in time, ms. freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
i have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  i will plan to see ms. freshwater back in 1 year.

segmentectomy in 2018. in between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in april 2013 and is status post chemo xrt.  i have reviewed ms. freshwater's 
recent  ct  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   the  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and i am happy with that too. at this point in time, i would recommend once 
a year annual ct scan.  i discussed with ms. freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  ct  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of ms. freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  history of left sided breast carcinoma -- t1b n0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. at this point in time, ms. freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
i have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  i will plan to see ms. freshwater back in 1 year.

principal  diagnosis:   stage  iii  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  now  with 
recurrent disease after definitive therapy with brain metastases.
 
current therapy:  the patient is receiving pembrolizumab every 3 weeks after 4 
cycles  of  carboplatin,  abraxane,  pembrolizumab.   she  also  completed  cyberknife 
radiation  therapy  to  the  right  frontal  and  left  temporal  brain  metastases  on  august  25, 
2022.
 
prior therapy: 
1.  the patient is status post 4 cycles of induction therapy with one cycle of cisplatin, 
taxotere and 3 cycles of carboplatin, taxol.
2.  the patient underwent bilobectomy, right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node dissection in january of 2021 revealing 2.8 cm squamous cell carcinoma of 40% 
viable tumor, 1.7 cm separate adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe, negative margins, 
no  lymphovascular  invasion.   one  out  of  11  lymph  nodes  involved,  ypt1c  n1a 
squamous cell carcinoma, t1b n0 adenocarcinoma.
3.  the patient had disease progression on bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound and 
biopsy of right hilar mass with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.
 
current medications:  ativan p.r.n., folic acid, norco p.r.n., plaquenil, magnesium, 
metoprolol, omeprazole, clonazepam p.r.n., eliquis, potassium, and iron sulfate 325 mg 
daily.
 
interval history:  the patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  she 
was last seen on september 8, 2022.  since that time, she continued on pembrolizumab.  
she  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  from  september  29th  to  october  4th  with  left  upper 
quadrant pain.  she was found to have a splenic infarction and she is now on eliquis.  
she reports some dyspnea with exertion.  she has pruritus mainly in her arms and her 
neck.   her  appetite  is  good.   her  energy  level  is  moderate.   her  left-sided  abdominal 
discomfort  has  improved  since  her  discharge  from  the  hospital  and  starting

principal  diagnosis:   stage  iii  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  now  with 
recurrent disease after definitive therapy with brain metastases.
 
current therapy:  the patient is receiving pembrolizumab every 3 weeks after 4 
cycles  of  carboplatin,  abraxane,  pembrolizumab.   she  also  completed  cyberknife 
radiation  therapy  to  the  right  frontal  and  left  temporal  brain  metastases  on  august  25, 
2022.
 
prior therapy: 
1.  the patient is status post 4 cycles of induction therapy with one cycle of cisplatin, 
taxotere and 3 cycles of carboplatin, taxol.
2.  the patient underwent bilobectomy, right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node dissection in january of 2021 revealing 2.8 cm squamous cell carcinoma of 40% 
viable tumor, 1.7 cm separate adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe, negative margins, 
no  lymphovascular  invasion.   one  out  of  11  lymph  nodes  involved,  ypt1c  n1a 
squamous cell carcinoma, t1b n0 adenocarcinoma.
3.  the patient had disease progression on bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound and 
biopsy of right hilar mass with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.

                          telemedicine telephone visit 

referring physician:  michal krauze, m.d.
 
diagnosis:  squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
icd-10 code:  c13.8.
 
stage:   synchronous  recurrent  stage  ivb  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  iva 
squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
history of present illness:  mr. scott is a 68-year-old male with a synchronous 
diagnosis  of  recurrent  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  iva  locally 
advanced  hypopharynx  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  had  a  prior  history  of  dual  primary 
stage iii non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2018 when he had stage pt3 n1 m0 
invasive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  right  upper  lobe  and  a  second  primary  large  cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma pt1b n0 m0.  he underwent right upper lobe lobectomy with 
an en bloc resection of chest wall ribs 2 and 3, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. at 
that time, he was subsequently followed and no evidence of disease until february of 
2022 when he was noted to have an enlarging right tracheoesophageal groove mass at 
the  thoracic  inlet  with  resulting  horseness.  additional  workup  including  pet/ct  scan 
performed february 10, 2022, noted an fdg avid lesion involving the right lateral aspect 
of  the  hypopharynx,  the  level  of  the  hyoid,  enlarged  right  level  2  and  3  lymph  node 
lesions as well as fdg avid tracheoesophageal groove adenopathy.  right upper lobe 
lung nodule and an fdg avid segment 4b   hepatic lesion measuring 3.2 cm concerning 
for metastatic disease.  additional workup including a ebus and biopsy of the level 2r 
mediastinal node was negative for malignant cells with scant cellularity.  he was referred 
to  ent  and  underwent  a  posterior  pharyngeal  wall  biopsy  of  right  posterior  pharynx 
showing  at  least  superficially  invasive  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  a  selective  neck 
dissection  of  right  level  6  contents  showed  metastatic  carcinoma  and  3  of  6  sampled 
lymph nodes with extranodal extension. lesion in the liver was felt to be too deep for 
biopsy.   mri  brain  was  performed  on  january  27,  2022  and  negative  for  brain 
metastasis,  initiated  on  additional  systemic  therapy  with  pembrolizumab  and 
pemetrexed,  completed  total  of  12  cycles  of  pembrolizumab  and  pralatrexate  and 
underwent  repeat  imaging  via  pet/ct  on  august  26,  2022  which  showed  persistent 
disease within the right piriform sinus and right neck with favorable response within the 
chest.  repeat ct chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis on november 28, 2022, showed a 
complete  response  of  his  head  and  neck  lesions  within  the  chest  with  a  stable  7  mm 
right lower lobe lung nodule and response of the previously documented on biopsy liver 
lesion; however, there was persistent unchanged primary tumor within the right piriform 
sinus  and  unchanged  metastatic  right  level  2,  3  cervical  adenopathy.   his  presenting 
symptom was hoarseness, but he tells me his voice quality is subjectively improved.  he 
has difficulty swallowing pills, but tells me is able to eat a normal diet.  he has no taste 
changes or xerostomia.  he presents in radiation oncology for discussion of palliative 
radiation  treatment  options  related  to  his  head  and  neck  prior  given  the  favorable 
response noted of his recurrent lung cancer.
 
prior radiation therapy:  none.
 
past medical history:  history of cerebrovascular accident, on coumadin. chronic 
ckd, peripheral artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, history of seizure disorder, 
copd, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, microcytic anemia, coronary artery disease.

cancer  and  second  primary  stage  iva  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  hypopharynx, 
status post palliative systemic therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab.
 
plan:  treatment options were reviewed, and case and findings were discussed with 
dr.  krauze.   given  his  favorable  response  of  his  metastatic  lung  cancer  to 
pembrolizumab  and  pemetrexed;  however,  with  persistence  of  his  head  and  neck 
cancer,  would  favor  consideration  of  palliative  radiotherapy  to  the  head  and  neck  to 
promote  local  control  and  maximize  his  disease-free  survival.   acute  as  well  as  late 
potential  radiation  related  side  effects  were  reviewed.  i  reviewed  the  rationale  for 
favoring short course radiotherapy over 5 fractions to improve his tolerance to treatment.  
all  the  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  his  satisfaction.   he  made  an  informed 
decision  towards  proceeding  with  radiotherapy,  we  will  schedule  him  for  ct  based 
simulation and plan to proceed next 1-2 weeks thereafter accordingly.  radiotherapy to 
be  completed  using  imrt/igrt  technique  to  spare  surrounding  critical  organs  at  risk 
including  spinal  cord,  parotid,  oral  cavity,  uninvolved  pharyngeal  constrictors, 
esophagus, cord.
 
thank you for the opportunity to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.  i 
spent approximately 25-30 minutes in this telephone telemedicine visit, inclusive of time 
reviewing his imaging, extensive medical records relating to his complex cancer, history 
of multiple primary lesions and discussing treatment options with him personally.

this consultation was provided via telephone between the patient and the provider.

                                   consultation

referring physician:  dr. david friedland
 
reason for referral: lung sbrt

icd code:  c34.32
 
stage:  t1b n0 m0, stage ia2
  
chief complaint:  left lower lobe early stage lung cancer.
 
history of present illness:  mr. benning is a 61- year- old man who initially had stage 
iiia non-small cell lung cancer of the right upper lobe.  he was treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, right upper lobe lobectomy with mediastinal nodal dissection and postoperative 
chemoradiotherapy, 60 gy in 30 fractions, which was completed on october 28, 2016.  he now 
has two left lower lobe pulmonary nodules that are conspicuous on imaging, for which he is 
referred for sbrt.  regarding his initial stage iiia lung cancer, he was found to have pd-l1 
expression of 80% as well as c-met amplification.  in the months following chemoradiotherapy, 
he was found to have 3 concerning nodules in the left lung that were questionable for discrete 
primary tumors versus related to the initial right lung cancer.  over the past 3-1/2 years, he was 
treated on upci 17-121 and had excellent response to immunotherapy with complete resolution 
of a nodule in the left upper lung.  in fact, he received durvalumab maintenance therapy until 
march 16, 2020, when it was discontinued in response to lft elevation.  on july 14, 2020, he 
saw dr. friedland in follow up.  surveillance ct of the chest and abdomen at that time showed 
no signs of disease below the diaphragm.  there are apparent post-surgical and post-radiation 
changes in the right lung and in the left lower lobe there are 2 nodules that have been followed 
since 2017 and likely represent discrete primary tumors.  i am asked to consider 
radiotherapeutic options for management of these left lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
 
review of systems:  denies cough.  denies shortness of breath.  denies fatigue.  a 12 -
point review of systems was obtained and was entirely negative.
 
past medical history:  copd.
 
family history:  brother died at age 63 of lung cancer.
 
social history:  former smoker, history of alcohol abuse.
 
physical examination:
constitutional:  kps 100, seated comfortably in no apparent distress.
vital signs:  temperature 98.5, pulse 72, respirations 16, blood pressure 132/83, oxygen 
saturation 98%.
eyes:  anicteric sclerae.  no lid lag.  perrl.
ent:  ears and nose appear normal.  wearing a mask over oropharynx.
neck:  trachea midline.  no thyromegaly.
lungs:  breathing comfortably in room air.  clear to auscultation bilaterally.
cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  no peripheral 
edema.
abdomen:  soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
lymphatic:  no appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
psychiatric:  alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.
 
imaging:  most recent ct chest from july 14, 2020, shows two left lower lobe nodules, one 
measuring 1.6 x 1.3 cm, which is on series 4, image 100 and then the other nodule measures 
0.9 x 0.6 cm and is at approximately the same level, but more anterior.  these have remained 
visible on imaging since 2017, whereas other suspicious lesions have entirely resolved.  there 
are no suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes nor is there any sign of metastatic disease, nor is 
there any evidence of disease recurrence of the right upper lobe disease.
 
assessment and plan:  this is a 61- year- old man initially with right upper lobe, stage iiia 
lung cancer treated with chemotherapy, surgery and chemoradiotherapy, who afterwards had 
suspicious lymph nodes and several pulmonary nodules in question, found on surveillance 
imaging, then received a long course of immunotherapy.  notably, his pd-l1 expression was 
80%.  over the last few years while other areas of suspicion have entirely resolved, there are 2 
left lower lobe pulmonary nodules in question for which i am asked to consider sbrt.  we 
discussed that the goal of radiotherapy would be to achieve local control of these pulmonary 
nodules, which appear to be unrelated to the initial disease in the right upper lobe.  i explained 
that sbrt radiotherapy is typically delivered in 3-5 fractions, based on the volume we are 
required to treat as well as the proximity of critical structures, such as the esophagus, heart and 
chest wall.  we discussed that in this situation based on the size of the tumors and the distance 
from the esophagus and heart, i think that his risk of esophagitis, pericarditis and pneumonitis 
are fortunately quite low.  we discussed options available to him, which include observation, 
although after considering the risks versus benefits of sbrt in detail, he would like to proceed 
with radiotherapy as recommended.  i explained the need for a complex simulation with motion 
management in order to ensure that we are delivering the best treatment possible considering 
that these tumors will likely move during the phases of respiration.  we discussed some of the 
technical challenges that sometimes arise from treating 2 tumors in the same organ and we will 
have to decide whether or not to use a 2 isocenter versus 1 isocenter approach.  i reviewed the 
recent ct scan with him in the office and showed him the size and location of the nodules.  he 
understands the specific goals, rationale, risks and team based approach of sbrt radiotherapy. 
i will arrange for his simulation and he will let us know if any questions or concerns arise.

                                   consultation

diagnosis:  small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, limited stage.
icd-10 code:  c34.32.
referring physician:  dr. silvia coleman, dr. peter daloni and dr. chad smith.
reason for consultation:  prophylactic cranial irradiation after completion of systemic 
chemotherapy with complete remission.
ronald valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 fdg-avid left lung lesions on 
pet/ct scan october 26, 2020.  one is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  on november 23, 2020, he underwent left vats, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  lymph node study was negative.  then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  then, restaging study, april 13th ct scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  mri of the brain april 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  he is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
past medical history:  atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
past surgical history:  prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, vats in november 2020, tonsillectomy.
current medications:  allopurinol, colchicine, coumadin, covid vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, lopressor, losartan, norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
allergies:  he is allergic to adhesive tape.
social history:  he has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  he drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
family history:  one sister had lung cancer.
review of systems:
constitutional:  he complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
integumentary:  unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
head:  unremarkable.
eyes:  he denies double vision or blurred vision.
ent:  he has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  he 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
respiratory:  unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
cardiovascular:  he has atrial fibrillation, on coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
gastrointestinal:  unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
genitourinary:  unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
musculoskeletal:  he has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
endocrine:  he has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
neurologic:  he had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  he 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
hematology:  he denies easy skin bruising.
laboratory findings:  we do not have a recent blood test, but on november 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, bun 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated gfr 68.  
wbc 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
imaging studies:  i personally reviewed pet/ct scan on october 26, 2020.  mri of the 
brain and most recent ct of the chest findings are stated in hpi.
physical examination:
general:  reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
vital signs:  he weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
heent:  there is no facial asymmetry.  extraocular movement is normal.
neck:  there is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
lungs:  showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
heart:  showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
lymphatics:  there is no murmur.
abdomen:  benign.
rectal:  deferred.
extremities:  without edema.
neurological:  reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  otherwise, unremarkable.
impression:  an 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by ct of the chest and mri 
of the brain on april 13, 2021.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

plan and recommendation:  ideally, i would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 gy, 2.5 gy per fraction.  however, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  i would like to leave this issue to 
dr. iheagwara.  also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

patient id#:        075180622
date of birth:      05/31/1941
date of visit:      06/15/2021

                                   consultation

diagnosis:  small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, limited stage.
icd-10 code:  c34.32.
referring physician:  dr. silvia coleman, dr. peter daloni and dr. chad smith.
reason for consultation:  prophylactic cranial irradiation after completion of systemic 
chemotherapy with complete remission.
ronald valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 fdg-avid left lung lesions on 
pet/ct scan october 26, 2020.  one is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  on november 23, 2020, he underwent left vats, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  lymph node study was negative.  then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  then, restaging study, april 13th ct scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  mri of the brain april 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  he is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
past medical history:  atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
past surgical history:  prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, vats in november 2020, tonsillectomy.
current medications:  allopurinol, colchicine, coumadin, covid vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, lopressor, losartan, norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
allergies:  he is allergic to adhesive tape.
social history:  he has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  he drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
family history:  one sister had lung cancer.
review of systems:
constitutional:  he complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
integumentary:  unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
head:  unremarkable.
eyes:  he denies double vision or blurred vision.
ent:  he has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  he 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
respiratory:  unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
cardiovascular:  he has atrial fibrillation, on coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
gastrointestinal:  unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
genitourinary:  unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
musculoskeletal:  he has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
endocrine:  he has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
neurologic:  he had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  he 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
hematology:  he denies easy skin bruising.
laboratory findings:  we do not have a recent blood test, but on november 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, bun 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated gfr 68.  
wbc 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
imaging studies:  i personally reviewed pet/ct scan on october 26, 2020.  mri of the 
brain and most recent ct of the chest findings are stated in hpi.
physical examination:
general:  reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
vital signs:  he weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
heent:  there is no facial asymmetry.  extraocular movement is normal.
neck:  there is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
lungs:  showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
heart:  showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
lymphatics:  there is no murmur.
abdomen:  benign.
rectal:  deferred.
extremities:  without edema.
neurological:  reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  otherwise, unremarkable.
impression:  an 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by ct of the chest and mri 
of the brain on april 13, 2021.  he is now referred to radiation oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

plan and recommendation:  ideally, i would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 gy, 2.5 gy per fraction.  however, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  i would like to leave this issue to 
dr. iheagwara.  also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

which he will continue.  he will return to clinic in 3 weeks.  he will continue to follow up 
with vascular surgery regarding ongoing claudication in his legs.  he understands that 
we have limited options beyond third line chemotherapy for his metastatic carcinoma of 
the lung and we may consider transition to hospice care if he has evidence of disease 
progression  or  does  not  tolerate  this  next  regimen.   he  is  dnr/dni.   his  wife  is  his 
medical power of attorney.  he will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the 
interim.

14.6, hematocrit 43.6, platelets 498.  complete metabolic profile significant for a sodium 
of 131, creatinine of 0.69, albumin of 3.4, calcium 10.5.
 
radiologic studies:  pet/ct scan from august 27th showed increase in fdg avid 
mass in the right paratracheal and pretracheal region, 4.5 x 3.5 cm, multifocal subcarinal 
fdg-avid lymphadenopathy up to 3.5 x 3 x 2.1 cm, slightly increase in size, rind of right 
lateral pleural fdg uptake is new, increased right external iliac nodal mass measuring 
6.2 x 3.9 cm with fdg uptake and increased right internal iliac fdg avid 4 cm lymph 
node, increasing sacral accumulation and fdg uptake.
 
assessment and plan:  63-year-old male with a history of hypertension, peripheral 
vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, portal vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, who presents

zometa  every  3  months  for  skeletal  metastases.   he  is  on  eliquis  for  atrial  fibrillation, 
which he will continue.  he will return to clinic in 3 weeks.  he will continue to follow up 
with vascular surgery regarding ongoing claudication in his legs.  he understands that 
we have limited options beyond third line chemotherapy for his metastatic carcinoma of 
the lung and we may consider transition to hospice care if he has evidence of disease 
progression  or  does  not  tolerate  this  next  regimen.   he  is  dnr/dni.   his  wife  is  his

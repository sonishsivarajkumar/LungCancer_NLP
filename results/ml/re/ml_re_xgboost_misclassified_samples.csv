year and half and has having almost complete remission.  Recently, he has had an upper 
respiratory viral-like infection about 3-week interval and lot of difficulty with how he feels.  
Overall, he has had some increased swelling in his lower extremity.  He has had decreased 
interest in food and appetite.  He has again lost about 5 pounds over the last month and half or 
so.  He is actually up a pound from last visit we saw him, however.  He still has some 
macrocytosis and some elevated LFTs, although improving.  He again declares that he is not 
drinking any alcohol at this time.  In the past, recall he has had significant difficulty with alcohol 
abuse.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No recent fevers or chills, night sweats.  No headaches or visual 
changes.  No lightheadedness or dizziness.  No cough or rhinorrhea.  He does have some sore 
throat and some hoarseness.  He has no chest discomfort.  He has some shortness of breath.  
No abdominal pain.  He has decreased appetite.  No nausea or vomiting.  No diarrhea or 
constipation.  No melena or hematochezia.  No peripheral rashes.  He does have bilateral lower 
extremity swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight today 153.5 from 152.4 last visit.  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 
134/85, pulse 76, respirations 16, pulse ox 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  ECOG performance status of 0.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  Conjunctivae are pink.  Oropharynx is clear without exudate or 
erythema.
NECK:  Supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  Overall some decreased breath sounds in the bases, but fairly clear.
HEART:  Tachy, but regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, no obvious hepatosplenomegaly.
PERIPHERAL:  Shows 1+ edema from about the mid shin down to the dorsum of the foot 
bilaterally.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed from May 24th showed white count of 7.9, hemoglobin 13.7, 
MCV 103.5, platelet count of 307.  Chemistries showed sodium 128, BUN and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  Calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, ALT of 25, AST of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
RADIOLOGY:  CT scan dated May 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  There was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  The 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  I believe he looks 
a little better than last time I saw him.  He still is somewhat suppressed.  He seems overtly 
depressed.  I am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  He says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time I encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  I 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  In general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
He has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which I think are probably accounting for some 
of the CT changes.  I have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  I know he is

received 60 Gy in 30 fractions.  The patient completed treatment on June 15, 2021.  The 
patient  received  one  treatment  of  immunotherapy,  however,  had  poor  tolerance.  
Therefore, immunotherapy was discontinued. 
 
Information for today's visit was obtained by both the patient and his wife.  The patient 
states he was experiencing back pain.  He had an x-ray performed at Tyrone Hospital 
ordered by his primary care physician.  The patient was told he had arthritic changes.  
He goes on to state he was seen by Dr. Mohammad Alkayem one day ago.  He was told 
by Dr. Alkayem that he had a compression fracture.  The patient goes on to state his 
primary care physician referred him to a neurologist.  He was started on Namenda.  The 
patient's  wife  has  noticed  an  improvement  in  the  patient's  memory  since  starting  the 
medication.  The patient's wife goes on to state the patient will have an MRI of the brain 
performed in December 2021.  The patient continues to have a cough.  He states his 
cough is intermittent and unchanged.  He has no hemoptysis.  He has no chest pain or 
pain with deep inspiration.  The patient states he has no unusual shortness of breath.  
He has no sore throat or difficulty swallowing.  He reports no headache or dizziness.  He 
states  with  the  exception  of  his  back  pain,  he  has  no  other  skeletal  discomfort.   The 
patient states his appetite is good and he is able to tolerate a regular diet.  The patient's 
wife  states  the  patient  is  not  as  active  as  he  was  in  the  past,  stating  he  is  rather 
sedentary. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
On exam today, the patient's weight is 151 pounds.  This is a ten pound increase from 
his  last  visit  in  July  2021.   No  cervical  or  clavicular  lymphadenopathy  is  appreciated.  
The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart has a regular rate and

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Briefly, he was initially diagnosed after having presented with 
progressive shortness of breath at which point in time, a CT scan demonstrated extensive 
thoracic adenopathy, parenchymal lung disease within the right lower lobe and a large right-
sided pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.  Biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node 
demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma with mutational testing, which was negative for 
EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and PD-L1.  It was at that point in time that he was recommended for 
initiation of systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed.  He completed whole brain 
radiotherapy to multiple metastatic lesions to the CNS at the beginning of March of 2017.
 
INTERIM HISTORY:  Mr. Maiorano returns to the office today for interim followup.  He really 
feels quite well and tolerated his first cycle of chemotherapy really without much by way of 
treatment-related side effects.  He was able to continue all of his day-to-day activities without 
any significant fatigue, decrease in appetite or weight loss.  He is making a conscious effort with 
the help of his son to eat a bit more healthy.  He does complain of his persistent sinus drainage 
which has been a long-term issue in addition to some sensation of fullness in both ears without 
any discrete pain.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Demonstrate a temperature of 97.2, his blood pressure is 140/70, pulse rate 71, 
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is a Caucasian male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Reveals no scleral icterus.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
NECK:  Stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring 
up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at this point in time
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  No palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  He is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
SKIN:  Reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Reveals no acute defect.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  His white count is 3.0 with an ANC of 2.3.  His hemoglobin is 11.3.  His 
platelet count is 252.  His comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits with the 
exception of a borderline glucose of 107.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Briefly, he was initially diagnosed after having presented with 
progressive shortness of breath at which point in time, a CT scan demonstrated extensive 
thoracic adenopathy, parenchymal lung disease within the right lower lobe and a large right-
sided pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.  Biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node 
demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma with mutational testing, which was negative for 
EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and PD-L1.  It was at that point in time that he was recommended for 
initiation of systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed.  He completed whole brain 
radiotherapy to multiple metastatic lesions to the CNS at the beginning of March of 2017.
 
INTERIM HISTORY:  Mr. Maiorano returns to the office today for interim followup.  He really 
feels quite well and tolerated his first cycle of chemotherapy really without much by way of 
treatment-related side effects.  He was able to continue all of his day-to-day activities without 
any significant fatigue, decrease in appetite or weight loss.  He is making a conscious effort with 
the help of his son to eat a bit more healthy.  He does complain of his persistent sinus drainage 
which has been a long-term issue in addition to some sensation of fullness in both ears without 
any discrete pain.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Demonstrate a temperature of 97.2, his blood pressure is 140/70, pulse rate 71, 
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is a Caucasian male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Reveals no scleral icterus.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
NECK:  Stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring 
up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at this point in time
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  No palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  He is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
SKIN:  Reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Reveals no acute defect.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  His white count is 3.0 with an ANC of 2.3.  His hemoglobin is 11.3.  His 
platelet count is 252.  His comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits with the 
exception of a borderline glucose of 107.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Maiorano is a 68-year-old gentleman presenting for ongoing 
treatment and evaluation of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology.  
He is currently presenting for cycle 2, day 1 of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed.  
It is notable that he actually tolerated his first cycle really quite well and as such, I would like to 
proceed with his second cycle of therapy today.
 
On physical exam, it does seem as though he has stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of 
the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at 
this point in time.  There is also some shotty lymphadenopathy throughout the fossa, which I 
think is also fairly stable, though perhaps a bit more mobile than on prior occasions.  We will

followup.   It  is  noted  that  the  patient  reports  that  her  skin  lesions  overall  have  been 
stable  on  the  use  of  triamcinolone  topical  cream.   Otherwise,  her  most  recent  CT 
imaging showed improvement of her lung cancer, which the patient is also very pleased. 
Given her fatigue and borderline renal function, we have to stop pemetrexed and only 
continue with single agent pembrolizumab.

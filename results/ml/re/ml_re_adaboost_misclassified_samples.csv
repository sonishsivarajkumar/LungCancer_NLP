ALLERGIES:
cats and house dust and mites resulting in congestion.
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  Her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   Her  ECOG 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
GENERAL:  She is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:  Supple, without lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   No  hepatosplenomegaly.   Hyperactive 
bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGIC:   Mild  bilateral  sensory  deficits  in  her  right  proximal  thigh,  left  greater 
than right.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today, her white count is 4.7, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.7, 
platelets are 266.  CMP really unremarkable.  Glucose 104.  TSH today is 0.886.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  The patient did have a CT scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. Of note, on the CT scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   We  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  So this is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  In addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones T1 and T5, which appeared to be stable.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Briefly, he was initially diagnosed after having presented with 
progressive shortness of breath at which point in time, a CT scan demonstrated extensive 
thoracic adenopathy, parenchymal lung disease within the right lower lobe and a large right-
sided pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.  Biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node 
demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma with mutational testing, which was negative for 
EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and PD-L1.  It was at that point in time that he was recommended for 
initiation of systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed.  He completed whole brain 
radiotherapy to multiple metastatic lesions to the CNS at the beginning of March of 2017.
 
INTERIM HISTORY:  Mr. Maiorano returns to the office today for interim followup.  He really 
feels quite well and tolerated his first cycle of chemotherapy really without much by way of 
treatment-related side effects.  He was able to continue all of his day-to-day activities without 
any significant fatigue, decrease in appetite or weight loss.  He is making a conscious effort with 
the help of his son to eat a bit more healthy.  He does complain of his persistent sinus drainage 
which has been a long-term issue in addition to some sensation of fullness in both ears without 
any discrete pain.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Demonstrate a temperature of 97.2, his blood pressure is 140/70, pulse rate 71, 
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is a Caucasian male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Reveals no scleral icterus.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
NECK:  Stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring 
up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at this point in time
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  No palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  He is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
SKIN:  Reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Reveals no acute defect.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  His white count is 3.0 with an ANC of 2.3.  His hemoglobin is 11.3.  His 
platelet count is 252.  His comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits with the 
exception of a borderline glucose of 107.

Ronald Valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 FDG-avid left lung lesions on 
PET/CT scan October 26, 2020.  One is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  On November 23, 2020, he underwent left VATS, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  Pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  Left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  Lymph node study was negative.  Then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  Then, restaging study, April 13th CT scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  MRI of the brain April 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  He is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, VATS in November 2020, tonsillectomy.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, colchicine, Coumadin, COVID vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, Lopressor, losartan, Norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
ALLERGIES:  HE IS ALLERGIC TO ADHESIVE TAPE.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  He drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:  One sister had lung cancer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  He complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
INTEGUMENTARY:  Unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
HEAD:  Unremarkable.
EYES:  He denies double vision or blurred vision.
ENT:  He has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  He 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
GENITOURINARY:  Unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  He has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
ENDOCRINE:  He has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
NEUROLOGIC:  He had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  He 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  Otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
HEMATOLOGY:  He denies easy skin bruising.
LABORATORY FINDINGS:  We do not have a recent blood test, but on November 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, BUN 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated GFR 68.  
WBC 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
IMAGING STUDIES:  I personally reviewed PET/CT scan on October 26, 2020.  MRI of the 
brain and most recent CT of the chest findings are stated in HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
VITAL SIGNS:  He weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
HEENT:  There is no facial asymmetry.  Extraocular movement is normal.
NECK:  There is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
LUNGS:  Showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
HEART:  Showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
LYMPHATICS:  There is no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
RECTAL:  Deferred.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  An 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Briefly, he was initially diagnosed after having presented with 
progressive shortness of breath at which point in time, a CT scan demonstrated extensive 
thoracic adenopathy, parenchymal lung disease within the right lower lobe and a large right-
sided pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis.  Biopsy of a right supraclavicular lymph node 
demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma with mutational testing, which was negative for 
EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and PD-L1.  It was at that point in time that he was recommended for 
initiation of systemic therapy with carboplatin, pemetrexed.  He completed whole brain 
radiotherapy to multiple metastatic lesions to the CNS at the beginning of March of 2017.
 
INTERIM HISTORY:  Mr. Maiorano returns to the office today for interim followup.  He really 
feels quite well and tolerated his first cycle of chemotherapy really without much by way of 
treatment-related side effects.  He was able to continue all of his day-to-day activities without 
any significant fatigue, decrease in appetite or weight loss.  He is making a conscious effort with 
the help of his son to eat a bit more healthy.  He does complain of his persistent sinus drainage 
which has been a long-term issue in addition to some sensation of fullness in both ears without 
any discrete pain.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Demonstrate a temperature of 97.2, his blood pressure is 140/70, pulse rate 71, 
respirations 16, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is a Caucasian male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Reveals no scleral icterus.  No oropharyngeal lesions.
NECK:  Stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring 
up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at this point in time
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  No palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  He is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
SKIN:  Reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Reveals no acute defect.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  His white count is 3.0 with an ANC of 2.3.  His hemoglobin is 11.3.  His 
platelet count is 252.  His comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits with the 
exception of a borderline glucose of 107.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Maiorano is a 68-year-old gentleman presenting for ongoing 
treatment and evaluation of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology.  
He is currently presenting for cycle 2, day 1 of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed.  
It is notable that he actually tolerated his first cycle really quite well and as such, I would like to 
proceed with his second cycle of therapy today.
 
On physical exam, it does seem as though he has stable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy of 
the right supraclavicular fossa, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, though it is fairly mobile at

SECONDARY  DIAGNOSIS:   Cutaneous  T-cell  lymphoma  with  overall  stable  disease.  
The patient is using triamcinolone that was given to her by Dermatology.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Roberta Gibson is a pleasant 65-year-old female who returns for 
followup.   It  is  noted  that  the  patient  reports  that  her  skin  lesions  overall  have  been 
stable  on  the  use  of  triamcinolone  topical  cream.   Otherwise,  her  most  recent  CT 
imaging showed improvement of her lung cancer, which the patient is also very pleased. 
Given her fatigue and borderline renal function, we have to stop pemetrexed and only 
continue with single agent pembrolizumab.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Zofran  as  needed,  amlodipine,  Ecotrin,  metformin  and 
hydrochlorothiazide.

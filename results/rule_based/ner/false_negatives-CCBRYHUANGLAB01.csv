REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Jason M. Bierenbaum, M.D.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Brain metastasis.
 
CODE:  C79.31.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Phelps returned for followup of his non-small 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases.   He  was  treated  with  stereotactic 
radiosurgery to the left frontal metastasis in August 2021.  He has been doing fairly well.  
He has had headaches for the past couple of days.  He had an MRI of the brain done 
today,which showed an increase in the old treated left frontal lesion to 1.8 cm with some 
increase in surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal changes.  There were no new lesions.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has noted some headaches for the past couple of days.  
Denied any vision change, focal weakness, difficulty walking.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  He was in NAD.
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 80, respirations 16, blood pressure 125/70, weight 149 pounds.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves were intact.  Motor function was 5/5.  Gait was intact.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  X-rays were reviewed.  MRI of the brain done today showed a 
1.8 cm left frontal lesion, which had increased compared to the MRI from August 4, 2022 
with some increase in surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal changes.  There were no new 
lesions.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  MRI of the brain done today showed some increase in the 
old treated left frontal lesion.  The MRI from February 2022 and August 2022 with some 
increase in surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal changes suspicious for recurrent disease.  
There were no new lesions.  Plan will be for a short followup MRI in 4-6 weeks.  If the left 
frontal lesion were to increase, then the plan would be to retreat with radiosurgery.
 
Total time spent on today's visit was 25 minutes. This included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests,  and  time  spent 
documenting today's service.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Ms. Pearson is a 79 year old female who presents to the clinic today for her first followup 
visit after completing treatment. To summarize her history, she was initially seen in our 
office in 2019 after being diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the right lung. She received 
radiation therapy to the right middle lobe lung tumor. She was treated with 60 Gy in 15 
fractions. Her treatment concluded on December 4, 2019. On followup imaging, she was 
noted to have a new left upper lobe lung mass. A PET/CT scan revealed FDG activity 
associated with the left upper lobe mass. A biopsy was not recommended due to the risk 
associated  with  the  procedure.  Radiation  therapy  was  recommended  to  the  left  upper 
lobe lung tumor. The left lung tumor received 60 Gy in 30 fractions, and her treatment 
concluded on September 20, 2020. She will continue to be followed closely, and in July 
2022  was  noted  to  have  a  right  lower  lobe  perihilar  nodule  that  increased  in  size 
compared to a CT scan from April 2022. The patient opted to pursue radiation therapy to 
this area as well. She received 36 Gy in 12 fractions to the mass in the right lower lobe 
of the lung. Her treatment concluded on August 31, 2022. She returns to the clinic today 
for her first followup visit after completing treatment.
 
Mrs. Pearson had a CT scan of the chest on November 21, 2022 to follow up from her 
recent  radiation.  While  in  the  Radiology  Department,  she  suffered  a  fall,  and  was 
subsequently seen in the emergency department. A CT scan of the head was negative. 
The results from her CT scan of the chest were reviewed with her at that time, and were 
noted  to  reveal  progressive  disease.  These  results  were  discussed  with  her  via 
telephone  by  Dr.  Jack  Schocker  on  Wednesday  November  23,  2022.  The  previously 
treated nodule within the left upper lobe has increased in size compared to the CT scan 
from July 2022. This nodule now measures 22 x 15 mm. The previously treated area in 
the  right  middle  lobe  remains  unchanged,  and  has  surrounding  stable  post-radiation 
changes. The recently treated area in the right lower lobe continues to enlarge, and is 
now eroding into the right 10th rib. Again, these findings were previously discussed with 
the patient.
 
Mrs. Pearson is tearful during today's visit. We discussed the fact that further radiation 
therapy  is  not  indicated  at  this  time,  per  Dr.  Jack  Schocker.  She  has  been  treated 
several  times,  and  her  disease  continues  to  progress.  Systemic  therapy  would  be  an 
appropriate option at this time, although choices will likely be limited due to her multiple 
sclerosis. I spoke with Dr. Mohammad Alkayem during our visit today, and he agrees to 
see her in the near future. She is concerned about her ongoing pain in the area of the 
destructive lesion of the posterior right 10th rib. A referral was placed to palliative care to 
discuss pain management. She reports ongoing shortness of breath, although she states 
this has not increased significantly. Her main concern is quantity of life, and living to see 
her  granddaughter  get  married  in  approximately  one  year.  Again,  she  is  tearful  during 
today's visit, and is difficult to engage in conversation.
 
On  exam,  she  is  alert,  oriented,  and  in  no  acute  distress.  Her  neck  is  supple  with  no 
masses  or  adenopathy.  Her  heart  has  a  regular  rate  and  rhythm,  and  her  lungs  have 
decreased breath sounds throughout. She has pain to palpation over the right posterior 
chest wall.
 
The patient will return to our office in two months for repeat evaluation. She will be seen 
by Dr. Mohammad Alkayem in the near future to discuss options for systemic therapy. A 
referral  was  placed  for  her  to  be  seen  by  palliative  care  to  discuss  pain  management 
options. Her questions were addressed to the best of my ability during today's visit. She 
will  contact  our  office  with  further  questions,  concerns,  or  need  to  be  seen.  This  was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  Dr.  Jack  Schocker,  who  was  available  throughout 
today's visit.

DATE OF VISIT:    11/03/2022

                                   Office Note 

DIAGNOSIS:   Stage  IV  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  originally  diagnosed  as  a  locally 
advanced adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 at 50% in the past, treated with 3 cycles of induction 
Alimta and cisplatin, followed by surgical resection in April 2019 with path at that time 
revealing a T2b N0 malignancy measuring 4.1 cm with no evidence for visceral pleural 
invasion, although angiolymphatic invasion was identified.  KRAS positive G12D.  PTEN 
positive. TP53 positive.  She subsequently developed brain metastasis and chest wall 
progression over 2 years ago, for which she received gamma knife followed by initiation 
of Keytruda on December 5, 2019 through August 3, 2021, at which point she stopped 
prematurely  due  to  worsening  renal  function.  In  that  regard,  she  has  required 
maintenance prednisone 1 mg daily, which is ongoing.
 
HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   Deb  presents  for  followup.   Since  our  last  visit  3 
months ago, she did develop a cough in September that sounds viral and has lingered.  
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath as well as new bone pain or headache.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   The  remainder  of  her  11-point  review  of  systems  was 
negative.
 
PAST MEDICAL, SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Otherwise unchanged.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Stable, afebrile.  Weight 170 pounds.  Pain score 0.  ECOG performance 
status 1.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
NECK:  Supple.
LYMPH NODE:  Negative.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
BACK:  Without CVA or spine tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal and intact.
 
DIAGNOSTICS:   Labs,  October  20,  2022,  white  count  7.6,  hemoglobin  11.8,  platelet 
count 248. BUN and creatinine 22 and 1.43.  AST and ALT 52 and 80 respectively with 
an alkaline phosphatase of 152.  TSH October 5, 2022 was normal.  CEA at that time 
was down to 0.8.
 
IMPRESSION:  Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer as outlined.
 
PLAN:  At this point, I have recommended reimaging based on her cough and I have 
asked her to come to the office after the scan to review results.  I will also repeat labs 
today and if her CEA is stable and LFTs continued to decrease, I will plan followup in 3 
months,  although  she  will  require  BMPs  on  a  every  4-week  basis.   I  will  defer  further 
titration of her steroid dose down as we have been unsuccessful on 2 occasions in the 
past, although she will discuss this further with Nephrology.  I have asked her to keep 
me informed of new bone pain, headache, or abdominal pain in the interim.  Of note, at 
progression,  I  would  favor  a  liquid  biopsy  followed  by  consideration  of  clinical  trial 
enrollment or possibly a KRAS inhibitor.

HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  BRAF  V600E  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   Of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   Significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  Synthroid.   In  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing Functional Medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   She  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   Her  appetite  is 
stable.   She  continues  to  walk.   She  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  She continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is 
otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  Her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   Her  ECOG 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
GENERAL:  She is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:  Supple, without lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   No  hepatosplenomegaly.   Hyperactive 
bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGIC:   Mild  bilateral  sensory  deficits  in  her  right  proximal  thigh,  left  greater 
than right.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today, her white count is 4.7, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.7, 
platelets are 266.  CMP really unremarkable.  Glucose 104.  TSH today is 0.886.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  The patient did have a CT scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. Of note, on the CT scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   We  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  So this is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  In addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones T1 and T5, which appeared to be stable.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
BRAF V600E mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   The  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  However, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. We may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. In addition, it has been 
a year since her MRI given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly MRI prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  The patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, high PD-L1 expression.

PRIOR THERAPY:
1. PET/CT scan, February 2015 revealing a 13 mm FDG avid left upper lobe nodule as well as 
left hilar adenopathy.
2. CT-guided left lung biopsy, February 18, 2015, revealed non-small cell lung carcinoma, 
histology unclassified.
3. Mediastinoscopy, April 6, 2018, positive left level 4 lymph node.
4. Received 3 cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin and Alimta, completed May 2015.
5. August 19, 2015, underwent left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node resection 
revealing a 1.5 cm invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, probable acinar type with 2/2 
lymph nodes positive in the left level 5 for T1a N1 disease.
6. Completed sequential chemoradiation with carboplatin and Taxol followed by radiation, 
January 4, 2016, through February 23, 2016.
7. Post-treatment CT scan, May 3, 2016, showed no evidence of residual disease.
8. Developed clinical lymphadenopathy in the left neck with ultrasound on July 26, 2016, 
showing multiple round, slightly enlarged lymph nodes, the largest measuring about 1.4 x 1.3 
and 0.9 cm in size respectively.
9. August 28, 2017, underwent biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node revealing 
metastatic carcinoma, non-small cell type. Molecular studies were negative for EGFR and ALK-
1. PD-L1 expression was high at 91%-100%.

CURRENT THERAPY:  Pembrolizumab 200 mg q.21 days, cycle 1, day 1 on October 3, 2017.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today for 
continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma with 
adenocarcinoma histology.  He has currently been on single-agent pembrolizumab for about a 
year and half and has having almost complete remission.  Recently, he has had an upper 
respiratory viral-like infection about 3-week interval and lot of difficulty with how he feels.  
Overall, he has had some increased swelling in his lower extremity.  He has had decreased 
interest in food and appetite.  He has again lost about 5 pounds over the last month and half or 
so.  He is actually up a pound from last visit we saw him, however.  He still has some 
macrocytosis and some elevated LFTs, although improving.  He again declares that he is not 
drinking any alcohol at this time.  In the past, recall he has had significant difficulty with alcohol 
abuse.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No recent fevers or chills, night sweats.  No headaches or visual 
changes.  No lightheadedness or dizziness.  No cough or rhinorrhea.  He does have some sore 
throat and some hoarseness.  He has no chest discomfort.  He has some shortness of breath.  
No abdominal pain.  He has decreased appetite.  No nausea or vomiting.  No diarrhea or 
constipation.  No melena or hematochezia.  No peripheral rashes.  He does have bilateral lower 
extremity swelling.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amlodipine.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Clonidine.
4.  Etodolac.
5.  Gabapentin.
6.  Hydroxyzine.
7.  Metoprolol.
8.  Mirtazapine.
9.  Omeprazole.
10.  Oxycodone.
11.  Spiriva.
12.  Ventolin.
13.  Symbicort.
14.  Stool softeners.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight today 153.5 from 152.4 last visit.  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 
134/85, pulse 76, respirations 16, pulse ox 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  ECOG performance status of 0.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  Conjunctivae are pink.  Oropharynx is clear without exudate or 
erythema.
NECK:  Supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  Overall some decreased breath sounds in the bases, but fairly clear.
HEART:  Tachy, but regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, no obvious hepatosplenomegaly.
PERIPHERAL:  Shows 1+ edema from about the mid shin down to the dorsum of the foot 
bilaterally.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed from May 24th showed white count of 7.9, hemoglobin 13.7, 
MCV 103.5, platelet count of 307.  Chemistries showed sodium 128, BUN and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  Calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, ALT of 25, AST of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
RADIOLOGY:  CT scan dated May 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  There was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  The 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  I believe he looks 
a little better than last time I saw him.  He still is somewhat suppressed.  He seems overtly 
depressed.  I am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  He says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time I encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  I 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  In general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
He has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which I think are probably accounting for some 
of the CT changes.  I have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  I know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  He may 
be becoming refractory to Keytruda, but I doubt at this point.  I plan to take him until October 
and then stop his Keytruda.  I also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  He does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  Again, I am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  I 
did put him on 20 of Lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  We will see him back for 
treatment on Wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  If he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

depressed.  I am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  He says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time I encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  I 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  In general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
He has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which I think are probably accounting for some 
of the CT changes.  I have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  I know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  He may 
be becoming refractory to Keytruda, but I doubt at this point.  I plan to take him until October 
and then stop his Keytruda.  I also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  He does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  Again, I am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  I 
did put him on 20 of Lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  We will see him back for 
treatment on Wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  If he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

 Nancy Cerovich is a pleasant lady with history of melanoma and lung cancer.  She returns 
today for followup.  She denies any other complaints, denies any other major issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  Negative.
CARDIAC:  Negative.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  No issues.
GENITOURINARY:  Negative.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Negative.
NEUROLOGIC:  Negative.
HEMATOLOGIC:  No easy bruisability.  No bleeding diathesis.
LYMPHATICS:  Negative.
Reminder of the review of systems negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Not in any distress, looks well.
HEENT:  PERRLA.  Normal oral cavity.
NECK:  No JVD.  No lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  S1, S2 heard.  No rubs.  No murmur.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation, equal air entry.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.  No tenderness, no distension.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  Pulses felt.

LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed and they are essentially within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Nancy Cerovich is a pleasant lady with
1.  Malignant melanoma with metastatic disease to the lymph node and she is currently on 
treatment with Opdivo.  She is doing very well and the lymph node is no longer evident and she 
is in remission with regard to the melanoma.
2.  She did have lung cancer and we did do stereotactic radiation and she was in remission and 
most recent PET scan shows that she is in remission.  Continue with observation.
3.  She does have a new lesion in her anterior mediastinum and it is pretty FDG avid, and I 
would recommend getting another CAT scan and if it shows any progression, I will probably look 
into the biopsy and even if it is stable disease, possibly we should look into getting a biopsy.

DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung, status post radiation, December 10, 2020.
2.  Evidence of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lung via biopsy, December 7, 
2021.  PD-L1 of 30%.
 
PREVIOUS THERAPY: Keytruda x12 doses.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Carboplatin and Taxol.  The patient is due for cycle 1 today.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Ms.  Smith  is  here  for  history  of  unresectable  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the lung, progressive. CT scan, September 15, 2022, showed new right-
sided rib metastasis.  There was an expansile lytic met in the anterior 6th rib.  The mass 
invaded  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing  multiple  hilar  structures,  which 
demonstrated  reocclusion  of  the  left  superior  pulmonary  vein,  though  no  change  in 
background pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient has been declining chemotherapy and was 
on Keytruda at that time.  At her last visit, the patient discussed starting chemotherapy 
with  Taxol  and  carboplatin.   She  is  here  today  to  start  that  chemotherapy.   The 
chemotherapy  has  been  on  hold  because  of  COVID  at  the  beginning  of  October.   On 
October 24, the patient continued to have discolored sputum from her cough and was 
still  not  feeling  well.   The  patient  then  was  admitted  to  St.  Margaret's  Hospital, 
September 16th due to left shoulder pain and was found to have a pathologic fracture of 
the left clavicle with large soft tissue mass involving the bone.  She then went on to have 
a  detailed  course  of  2D  technique  radiotherapy  for  palliative  treatment  of  her  bone 
metastasis.   The  patient  was  discharged  on  November  18th  to  skilled  nursing  facility.  
The patient states she signed herself out and is now living at home.  On November 30th, 
the  patient  went  to  the  Emergency  Room  at  St.  Margaret's  complaining  of  worsening 
neuropathy,  poor  appetite,  poor  fluid  intake.   The  patient  was  given  IV  fluids  and  was 
found  to  have  a  chronic  sacral  decubitus  with  no  infections.   The  patient  had  no 
evidence  of  UTI.   No  infection  around  the  PowerPort.    She  was  given  IV  fluids  for 
rehydration  and  was  discharged.   Today,  the  patient  states  she  wants  to  start  her 
chemotherapy.  She still has pain in that left shoulder and is taking OxyContin.  She has 
the wound at the base of her spine that is being cared for by the visiting nurses.  She 
states  her  appetite  is  very  poor.   She  does  drink  Carnation  Instant  Breakfast  and  can 
only take small amounts at a time.  She has lost weight.  She has neuropathy from the 
waist down, which has been ongoing, it feels like pins and needles.  She has pain in her 
back, in her joints, and her left shoulder.  She gets dizziness if she sits up after lying 
down.  She uses a wheelchair all the time and is not walking and needs assistance at 
home.  She wears her O2 at 3-5 liters and she complains of chronic nausea.  There has 
been no bleeding, bruising, fever, chills, or night sweats.
 
ALLERGIES:  ERYTHROMYCIN, ADHESIVE BANDAGE, PINE OIL, LATEX.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Aspirin,  azathioprine,  Flovent,  Humalog,  Imuran,

with  Keytruda  and  had  12  doses,  then  she  was  noted  to  have  a  right-sided  rib 
metastasis  and  plan  was  to  start  Taxol  and  carboplatin.   The  patient  then  developed 
COVID  and  recovered  from  COVID,  so  treatment  was  delayed.   She  then  was 
hospitalized and discharged from St. Margaret's Hospital on November 18th.  She was 
found to have a left shoulder pathologic fracture of the left clavicle with large soft tissue 
mass  involving  the  bone.   She  completed  2D  technique  radiotherapy  for  palliative 
treatment of her bone metastasis.  The patient was then discharged to skilled nursing 
facility.  She went to the ER on November 30th and was noted to be dehydrated.  She 
was  rehydrated  and  released.  The  patient  signed  herself  out  of  skilled  nursing  facility 
and is now living at home.  She is here today and request to have her chemotherapy 
treatment  today.   The  patient  is  aware  that  treatment  can  cause  life-altering  or  life-
threatening side effects.  The patient to call our office for any side effects.  Encouraged 
her  to  increase  her  fluid  intake  and  eat  small  meals.   We  will  continue  to  monitor  the 
patient closely for toxicities of treatment.  All the patient's questions were answered to 
her satisfaction.  She is to follow up in our office in 3 weeks or sooner if indicated.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Mr. Nebgen is an 84 year old gentleman seen for a followup visit in the office today.  The 
patient is accompanied to the exam room by his wife.  To review the patient's history, the 
patient was found to have nodules in his right lung.  In January 2021, the patient had a 
CT-guided biopsy of a right apical lung mass.  Pathology showed adenocarcinoma.  A 
biopsy was then performed of a right middle lobe mass.  Pathology showed squamous 
cell carcinoma.  A PET/CT scan was then performed.  The radiologist described three 
intensely  hypermetabolic  right  lung  masses.   Two  nodules  were  located  in  the  right 
upper lobe and one was in the right middle lobe.  There is no evidence of mediastinal 
metastasis.   The  patient  received  concurrent  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy.  
Radiation  therapy  was  given  to  all  three  hypermetabolic  lung  nodules.   The  patient 
received 60 Gy in 30 fractions.  The patient completed treatment on June 15, 2021.  The 
patient  received  one  treatment  of  immunotherapy,  however,  had  poor  tolerance.  
Therefore, immunotherapy was discontinued. 
 
Information for today's visit was obtained by both the patient and his wife.  The patient 
states he was experiencing back pain.  He had an x-ray performed at Tyrone Hospital 
ordered by his primary care physician.  The patient was told he had arthritic changes.  
He goes on to state he was seen by Dr. Mohammad Alkayem one day ago.  He was told 
by Dr. Alkayem that he had a compression fracture.  The patient goes on to state his 
primary care physician referred him to a neurologist.  He was started on Namenda.  The 
patient's  wife  has  noticed  an  improvement  in  the  patient's  memory  since  starting  the 
medication.  The patient's wife goes on to state the patient will have an MRI of the brain 
performed in December 2021.  The patient continues to have a cough.  He states his 
cough is intermittent and unchanged.  He has no hemoptysis.  He has no chest pain or 
pain with deep inspiration.  The patient states he has no unusual shortness of breath.  
He has no sore throat or difficulty swallowing.  He reports no headache or dizziness.  He 
states  with  the  exception  of  his  back  pain,  he  has  no  other  skeletal  discomfort.   The 
patient states his appetite is good and he is able to tolerate a regular diet.  The patient's 
wife  states  the  patient  is  not  as  active  as  he  was  in  the  past,  stating  he  is  rather 
sedentary. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
On exam today, the patient's weight is 151 pounds.  This is a ten pound increase from 
his  last  visit  in  July  2021.   No  cervical  or  clavicular  lymphadenopathy  is  appreciated.  
The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart has a regular rate and 
rhythm.   The  patient's  abdomen  is  soft  and  nontender.   The  patient  had  a  CT  of  the 
chest performed on November 10, 2021.  I had the opportunity to review the images with 
Dr. Schocker prior to the patient's appointment today.  There is a decrease in the size of 
the  right  upper  lobe  apical  lung  nodule.  Fibrotic  changes  were  seen,  thought  to  be 
related to the patient's radiation therapy.
 
The  patient  is  clinically  doing  well.   Upon  review  of  Dr.  Mohammad  Alkayem's  office 
note, it appears a CT of the chest was requested to be performed in four months.  The 
patient's wife states the scan will be performed in March 2022.  Therefore, we will see 
the  patient  back  in  our  office  in  early  April  2022.   The  patient  and  his  wife  are 
encouraged to call with any questions or concerns they may have. This was discussed 
and agreed upon with Dr. Schocker.  Dr. Mark Alden was available during the patient's 
appointment today.

DATE OF BIRTH:      01/13/1955
DATE OF VISIT:      09/03/2019

                                   OFFICE NOTE

 DIAGNOSES:
1.  Small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage, presenting as mediastinal adenopathy 
for which he completed 4 cycles of VP-16 and carboplatin with cycles 2 and 3, utilizing 
concurrent radiation.
2.  Distant history of a stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, EGFR and 
ALK negative with mutated KRAS at presentation.  He initially underwent surgical resection 
in September 2012, with what appeared to be a locally advanced process with path 
demonstrating involvement of 7 of 14 lymph nodes.  Postop, he completed 4 cycles of 
adjuvant Alimta and cisplatin, but unfortunately was found to have brain metastases in 
September 2013 for which he received gamma knife.  In January 2018, there was concern 
for a new right lung lesion, prompting a PET scan that confirmed uptake, followed by 
CyberKnife to the lesion x3 in April 2018, after which he entered in observation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  John returns for followup.  Since our last visit, he did 
complete chemoradiation and now has undergone a PET scan, which will be summarized 
below.  He was able to quit smoking in July 24.  He denies new bone pain and actually 
reports his energy levels are improving.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The remainder of his 11-point review of systems was negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 143/88, vital signs otherwise stable.  Pain score is 0.  ECOG 
performance status 0.
HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  EOMI.  Anicteric sclerae, moist mucus 
membranes without exudate, erythema, or hemorrhage.
NECK:  Supple.
LYMPH NODE:  Negative.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular, not tachycardic.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without organomegaly.
BACK:  Without CVA or spine tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal and intact.

DIAGNOSTICS:  Labs dated July 16, 2019, white count 7.1, hemoglobin 11.5, platelet count 
98,000.  CEA at that point was 3.6.  MRI of the brain on August 26, 2019 was negative.  
PET/CT on August 29, 2019 failed to demonstrate new or progressive disease and there 
was marked improvement of the previous studies, although there were still a few slightly 
enlarged nodes and mild PET avidity.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage as outlined.
2.  Distant history of a non-small cell lung cancer.

PLAN:  At this point, based on the near complete response, I have recommended followup 
with Radiation Oncology to discuss possible prophylactic cranial irradiation, although I am 
not sure he is a candidate given his past history of gamma knife.  At this point, he is 
concerned about the potential for dementia and thus will discuss this further with Dr. Mehta 
prior to making a decision.  From the standpoint of his small cell lung cancer, I have 
recommended a short interval repeat CAT scan in 2 months after which I will decrease to q. 
3-month imaging through year 1.  He will need a q. 6-8 week port flush in the interim and I 
have asked him to keep me informed of new headache, bone pain, abdominal pain, or other 
new health issues.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Liza Villaruz.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Right upper lobe presumed non-small cell lung cancer.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.11.
 
INTERVAL SINCE TREATMENT:  Three months.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman with a history of prior 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for left upper lobe non-small cell lung 
cancer.  She was then developed an enlarging right upper lobe nodule.  MRI brain and PET/CT 
were negative for disease elsewhere.  Biopsy was suboptimal sampling, but showed atypical 
cells, SUV uptake was 4.33 on September 22, 2020, PET/CT.  The nodule in question was 
treated with SBRT 48 Gy in 4 fractions from October 27, 2020 to November 4, 2020.  Treatment 
was well tolerated without acute side effects. Following receipt of SBRT,  she also had no side 
effects: no cough, no fatigue, no shortness of breath.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies lack of appetite, denies fever, denies cough, denies 
hemoptysis, denies chest pain.  Twelve -point review of systems was obtained and was 
negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  ECOG 1.  Seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 93, respirations 16, blood pressure 114/71, oxygen 
saturation 98% on supplemental oxygen.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Oropharynx obscured by mask.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably on supplemental oxygen.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCH:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.  
 
IMAGING:  I personally reviewed the available imaging consisting of a CT chest without contrast 
obtained earlier today, which shows that the treated right upper lobe nodule has nearly 
completely resolved.  There is only minimal linear opacification along the minor fissure left in its 
place.  There is no sign of radiation pneumonitis, nor fibrosis.  There is no sign of disease 
elsewhere.  Overall, this is a favorable response to treatment.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman who underwent SBRT 48 
Gy in 4 fractions for an empiric non-small cell lung cancer, although did have atypical cells on 
the biopsy specimen.  She has had almost a complete response to SBRT.  She is without any 
side effects attributable to radiotherapy.  We will continue to follow and plan to see her back in 3 
months in coordination with Dr. Villaruz.

cells, SUV uptake was 4.33 on September 22, 2020, PET/CT.  The nodule in question was 
treated with SBRT 48 Gy in 4 fractions from October 27, 2020 to November 4, 2020.  Treatment 
was well tolerated without acute side effects. Following receipt of SBRT,  she also had no side 
effects: no cough, no fatigue, no shortness of breath.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies lack of appetite, denies fever, denies cough, denies 
hemoptysis, denies chest pain.  Twelve -point review of systems was obtained and was 
negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  ECOG 1.  Seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 93, respirations 16, blood pressure 114/71, oxygen 
saturation 98% on supplemental oxygen.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Oropharynx obscured by mask.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably on supplemental oxygen.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCH:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.  
 
IMAGING:  I personally reviewed the available imaging consisting of a CT chest without contrast 
obtained earlier today, which shows that the treated right upper lobe nodule has nearly 
completely resolved.  There is only minimal linear opacification along the minor fissure left in its 
place.  There is no sign of radiation pneumonitis, nor fibrosis.  There is no sign of disease 
elsewhere.  Overall, this is a favorable response to treatment.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman who underwent SBRT 48 
Gy in 4 fractions for an empiric non-small cell lung cancer, although did have atypical cells on 
the biopsy specimen.  She has had almost a complete response to SBRT.  She is without any 
side effects attributable to radiotherapy.  We will continue to follow and plan to see her back in 3 
months in coordination with Dr. Villaruz.

metastases.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  The patient is receiving pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.  She is 
status post 4 cycles of carboplatin, Abraxane, pembrolizumab.
 
PRIOR THERAPY:  
1.  The patient received 4 cycles of induction therapy with 1 cycle of cisplatin, Taxotere, 
and 3 cycles of carboplatin and Taxol for stage III disease.
2.  The patient underwent bilobectomy right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node  dissection  in  January  2021  revealing  2.8  cm  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  40% 
viable tumor, 1.7 cm separate adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe, negative margins, 
no  lymphovascular  invasion,  1/11  lymph  nodes  involved,  ypT1c  N1a  squamous  cell 
carcinoma, T1b N0 adenocarcinoma.
3.   The  patient  had  disease  progression  on  bronchoscopy.   Endobronchial  ultrasound 
and biopsy of a right hilar mass showed recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.
4.  The patient received CyberKnife radiation therapy to the right frontal and left temporal 
brain metastasis in August of 2022.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Ativan p.r.n., folic acid, Norco p.r.n., Plaquenil, magnesium, 
metoprolol,  omeprazole,  clonazepam  p.r.n.,  Eliquis,  prednisone,  iron  sulfate  325  mg 
daily, and she is on a steroid taper.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  She 
was last seen on October 20, 2022.  Since that time, she continued on pembrolizumab.  
She also received a dose of Zometa on October 21st for hypercalcemia.  Her appetite is 
good.  Her energy level is moderate.  She has some intermittent dyspnea with exertion.  
She has some diffuse arthritis, which has been worse over the past few weeks and she 
was started on a steroid taper by her rheumatologist this week with some improvement.  
She has had no bleeding.  She has had no recent infections.  She has had no fevers, 
chills,  headaches,  chest  pain,  cough,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  constipation, 
abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  97.7,  heart  rate  54,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
138/98, weight 140 pounds.  Performance status is 1.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress, comfortable.
HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds.   No  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
CHEST:  Left-sided MediPort in place.
EXTREMITIES:   No  edema  of  her  lower  extremities.   No  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  No focal neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  From October 20th, white blood cell count 5.1, hemoglobin 
11.0,  hematocrit  32.1,  platelets  170.   Thyroid  function  testing  was  normal.   From 
November 10th, basic metabolic profile is significant for a creatinine 1.76, calcium 8.7.
 
RADIOLOGIC  STUDIES:   MRI  of  the  brain  from  November  30th  showed  stable  to 
minimally increased size of left temporal ring-enhancing metastasis, punctate metastasis 
in the posterior left temporal lobe is new, new left frontal opercular metastasis, and the 
right frontal opercular punctate metastasis seen in August is barely perceptible on the 
current study.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  She initially had stage III 
disease  and  she  had  recurrence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  after  receiving  induction 
chemotherapy  and  surgery.   She  is  status  post  carboplatin,  Abraxane,  and 
pembrolizumab  chemoimmunotherapy  for  4  cycles,  and  she  is  now  receiving 
pembrolizumab maintenance.  She underwent CyberKnife radiation therapy to the brain 
metastases  in  August.   I  reviewed  her  MRI  of  the  brain  from  yesterday,  which  shows 
possibly 2 new areas of brain metastases.  She has an appointment to see Dr. Burton 
next week and I will contact him regarding the results of the MRI of the brain.  For now, 
she  will  continue  on  pembrolizumab  without  dose  modifications.   We  will  plan  for 
restaging  CT  of  the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  in  6  weeks.   We  will  obtain  a  CBC, 
complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies  today.   We  will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  She has 
hypercalcemia associated with malignancy and she will have a repeat basic metabolic 
profile  in  3  weeks  and  we  will  administer  additional  Zometa  as  necessary.   She  will 
continue  on  iron  sulfate  daily.   She  will  continue  on  Eliquis  for  her  recent  splenic 
infarction,  which  is  likely  related  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.  
She will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

PATIENT ID#:      075622312
DATE OF BIRTH:    01/20/1937
DATE OF VISIT:    01/12/2023

                                   Office Note 

PRINCIPAL  DIAGNOSIS:   Metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  left  adrenal 
metastases,  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy,  PD-L1  positive  at  2%,  no  actionable 
mutations identified.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.  This has been on hold for the 
past 6 weeks.
 
PRIOR THERAPY:
1.   The  patient  underwent  left  lower  lobectomy  in  July  2018  revealing  poorly 
differentiated  adenocarcinoma  involving  the  visceral  pleural  surface,  focal 
lymphovascular invasion.  One out of one lymph nodes involved.  Pathologic stage T2 
N1, stage IIB.
2.  The patient received 4 cycles of carboplatin and Alimta in the adjuvant setting.
3.  The patient was found to have a new right upper lobe nodule concerning for residual 
disease.   She  underwent  right  upper  lobe  anterior  segmentectomy  in  February  2019, 
which showed invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins, T1b N0.
4.  The patient was found to have left adrenal nodule with FDG uptake in July 2019.  She 
underwent  left  adrenalectomy  in  August  2019,  which  showed  a  2.5  cm  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma with negative margins.
5.  The patient was found to have FDG-avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy and several 
bilateral pulmonary nodules and she was started on systemic therapy.
6.  The patient was started on carboplatin, Taxol, and pembrolizumab for 4 cycles and 
has been on pembrolizumab maintenance.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Breo Ellipta, budesonide, buspirone, multivitamin, Colace, 
Pepcid,  iron  sulfate  daily,  folic  acid,  Lasix  p.r.n.,  gabapentin,  Incruse  Ellipta,  and 
metformin.  The patient was previously on methotrexate weekly, but this was stopped 2 
weeks  ago.   Metoprolol,  Protonix,  probiotic,  Carafate,  Tylenol  p.r.n.,  albuterol  p.r.n., 
vitamin  B  complex,  vitamin  D,  Lovenox  injections  twice  daily,  prednisone  10  mg  daily, 
and Imodium p.r.n.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  She 
was last seen on November 29, 2022.  Since that time, her pembrolizumab has been on 
hold.   Due  to  concern  for  possible  pneumonitis,  she  has  been  on  prednisone  10  mg 
daily; however, her dyspnea with exertion has not improved and has actually worsened 
over the past few weeks.  She is wearing 5 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula at night and 
she wakes up at night with shortness of breath.  Her appetite is moderate.  Her energy 
level  is  low.   She  has  occasional  headache.   She  has  chronic  cough.   She  has  had 
diarrhea for the past week and she has been taking Imodium as needed.  She has some 
abdominal cramping associated with bowel movements over the past week as well.  She 
has had no bleeding.  She has had no recent infections.  She has no fevers, chills, chest 
pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or urinary symptoms.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  96.7,  heart  rate  77,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
105/66, weight 198 pounds.  Performance status is 3.
GENERAL:  No acute distress, comfortable, elderly female in a wheelchair.
HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:   The  patient  has  decreased  breath  sounds  at  the  right  lung  base.   No 
wheezing is appreciated.
CHEST:  Left-sided MediPort in place.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, mild tenderness to palpation diffusely, nondistended.  Positive bowel 
sounds, no palpable hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Edema of lower extremities bilaterally.  No cyanosis, clubbing, or calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  The patient is generally weak.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  From December 28th, white blood cell count 8.9, hemoglobin 
11.1, hematocrit 33.9, platelets 247.  From November 29th, complete metabolic profile 
significant for creatinine of 1.07.  TSH 1.48, free T4 of 1.4.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   85-year-old  female  with  a  history  of  deep  venous 
thrombosis,  status  post  IVC  filter,  now  on  Lovenox  due  to  recent  left  lower  extremity 
deep  venous  thrombosis  and  Xarelto  failure,  atrial  fibrillation,  gastroesophageal  reflux 
disease,  prior  stroke,  cerebral  hemorrhage,  history  of  anxiety,  mild  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease,  history  of  localized  breast  cancer  10  years  ago,  who  presents  for 
followup for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially stage IIB disease, now with 
recurrence in the right upper lobe after surgery and chemotherapy.  She developed left 
adrenal  metastases,  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy.   Tumor  is  PD-L1  positive,  KRAS 
mutation  positive.   No  actionable  mutations  identified.   She  has  been  receiving 
pembrolizumab  maintenance,  but  this  was  held  over  the  past  6  weeks  due  to 
immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis.  She has been on prednisone 10 mg daily, but her 
breathing has gotten worse.  She had a CT of the chest due prior to this appointment, 
but she was unable to go due to diarrhea.  We will continue to hold the pembrolizumab 
as she is clinically worse.  We will obtain a chest x-ray due to concern for possible right 
pleural effusion based on my exam today and we will plan for repeat CT of the chest as 
soon as possible.  For now, she will continue on prednisone.  We will continue to hold 
the pembrolizumab and she will continue on Lovenox for history of thrombosis.  We will 
tentatively make an appointment for return to clinic in 6 weeks.  Her methotrexate has 
been  recently  held  by  her  rheumatologist  and  she  was  due  to  start  Arava,  but  I 
recommend  holding  this  until  she  is  feeling  better.   For  now,  she  will  continue  on 
Imodium for the diarrhea, but if this worsens or if her breathing worsens, she may need 
to go to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.  She will contact our office for 
any questions or concerns in the interim.

Dear Dr. Malvar:
 
Mrs. Vasquez presents today for followup of stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung, currently on 
Opdivo.  On March 21, 2019, she had a CAT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which 
showed no evidence of progression.  She has a stable right upper lobe nodule 2 x 1.6 cm and 
no evidence of any other disease.  She does have a right hilar lymph node 2.8 cm in size.  She 
reports some dysesthesia in her fingertips, but is otherwise without complaints.  She is finding it 
more difficult to continue to come to the cancer center in Beaver and wishes to follow up further 
at UPMC in New Castle.
 
She actually initially was seen by Dr. Simon in New Castle in approximately December 2014.  
She initially underwent resection of the left lower lobe nodule approximately in April 2014 for a 
T2aN0M0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, that looks subtypes of papillary, acinar, 
and lepidic, 3.5 x 2.8 x 3.5 cm incised.  Followup in August 2014 with CT scan showed multiple 
pulmonary nodules and further followup in December 2014 showed these are not glucose avid.  
The nodules continued to increase and she was evaluated by Ryan Levy, MD.  and by Dr. Kaul 
on November 2, 2015.  She got a biopsy of her right lower lobe nodule which showed recurrent 
adenocarcinoma of the lung, TTF-1 positive, CK7 positive, CK20 negative.  This had a lepidic 
growth pattern.  EGFR was negative and ALK1 was negative.  This was performed at Heritage 
Valley Beaver.  At that time, although additional driver mutations were not available and they 
have not been performed.  She was treated with carboplatin and Alimta from March 8, 2016, to 
May 17, 2016, followed by Alimta maintenance until August 10, 2016.  In October 2016, she had 
an increase in the pulmonary nodules, so on November 2, 2016, she was started on Opdivo 
with a complete response and continues to do well on this regimen.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All systems reviewed and as per HPI.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 148 pounds, temperature 98.5, pulse 67, respirations 16, blood 
pressure 165/58, O2 saturation 100%, pain 0/10, fatigue 0/10.
GENERAL:  Sitting comfortably in no apparent distress.
EYES:  Conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis.  Pupils and irides are 
equal and normally reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact, without scleral icterus.
EARS, NOSE, MOUTH AND THROAT:  Nasal mucosa, septum, and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear.  Oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudate.
NODES:  There are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal area.
SKIN:  No abnormal nevi, ecchymoses, petechiae, rashes or masses on inspection or palpation.
CHEST:  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Auscultation of the heart reveals no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Carotid 
arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
ABDOMEN:  No hepatosplenomegaly, guarding, tenderness or masses.  Bowel sounds are 
normal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Extremities show no edema, clubbing, cyanosis or joint deformity.  No 
tenderness on percussion of the spine.
 
IMPRESSION:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Continue Opdivo consistent with the FDA dosing recommendation.  
She does have some interest in stopping the therapy if possible. She will follow up at the  
UPMC Cancer Center in New Castle.  If there are any additional questions or anything that I can 
do to help with transition and care, do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Sincerely,

DATE OF VISIT:      09/11/2019

                                   CONSULTATION

DIAGNOSES: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Now presenting with progressively worsening left 
shoulder pain due to lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum.
ICD-10 CODE: C34.32, C79.51
CONSULTATION: Freda is a 71-year-old white female who is well-known to our department, 
having just recently completed a course of potentially curative radiotherapy to the LLL 1o tumor 
and adjacent left hilum and mediastinum; she did receive 40 Gy of external beam RT following a 
single 10 Gy SBRT treatment administered by Dr. Steve Burton at UPMC Shadyside in 
Pittsburgh (SBRT was discontinued 2o to concern about high potential gastric radiation dose).
Since completing treatment, Freda has been feeling extremely weak and tired. However, her 
most bothersome problem has been progressively worsening pain in her left shoulder. Recent 
radionuclide bone scan (8/30/19) had shown some increased uptake in the inferior aspect of the 
glenoid labrum of the left scapula, corresponding to an area of lytic lesion, which had previously 
been identified on chest CT (6/18/19). This is now felt to be clearly consistent with metastatic 
disease. In addition, focal areas of uptake was seen in left posterior 9th and 10 ribs, which were 
felt to represent healing rib fractures. A subtle focus of increased radionuclide uptake was seen 
in the mid-shaft of the left femur, which was felt to be 2o to possible metastatic lesion. Left 
shoulder MRI (8/23/19), had shown a slightly displaced fracture through the blade of the 
scapula, and there was some bone marrow edema seen along the superior and posterior 
margin of the glenoid process (which could potentially represent metastatic disease).
From a respiratory standpoint, Freda's status has been fairly stable, although she does report 
significant exertional dyspnea even with relatively minimal activity. Unfortunately, her appetite 
has been very poor, and she has lost an additional seven pounds since completing radiotherapy 
on 7/16/19.
MEDICAL/SURGICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: See previous consultation (6/6/19).
EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Weight: 94.4 pounds. Height: 61"". BMI= 17.9 kg/m2. Pulse: 106 min-1. 
Respirations: 16 min-1 (unlabored). Blood Pressure: 155/75 mmHg. Oxygen Saturation= 95% 
(room air at rest). Karnofsky Performance Status= 70%.
SKIN: 1-2+ residual hyperpigmentation posteriorly, no desquamation apparent.
HEENT: Oral cavity without apparent candidiasis.
LYMPH NODES: No adenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or peri-umbilical regions.
CHEST: Trachea midline, no suprasternal fullness.
LUNGS: Clear bilaterally with fairly good aeration and the bronchial breath sounds previously 
present centrally on the left were much less prominent. Peak Expiratory Flow= 130 liters/minute 
(41% predicted).
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm. No audible murmurs or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Non-tender. Liver span= 8.0 cm.
SKELETAL: There is mild-to-moderate tenderness with palpation about the glenoid socket of 
the shoulder joint posteriorly. No pain on upward percussion of the left humerus. Mild 
tenderness in the mid left femur (~20 cm below the top of the greater trochanter). No other 
significant tenderness with percussion along spinal axis, over the pelvic bones, chest wall 
(including left posterior 9th and 10 ribs), right femur and bilateral humeri.
IMPRESSION: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Freda presents with her first definite manifestation 
of distant metastatic disease, now with progressively worsening left shoulder pain due to 
destructive lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum. She also manifests highly 
suspicious tenderness corresponding to a positive bone scan finding in the left mid-femur (which 
is a ""weight-bearing bone""). 
Detailed discussion was held Freda and her son regarding the indications, technique, potential 
side effects and anticipated results from palliative radiotherapy directed at this left scapular 
metastatic lesion. I stressed to them that her papillary serous endometrial CA has been 
documented previously to be highly radioresponsive in that Joan had achieved essentially 
complete response at the end of 45 Gy pelvic RT, and addition of the ~24 Gy from the Syed 
HDR brachytherapy implant resulted in long-term locoregional tumor control. Furthermore, I 
stressed that since her lower extremity motor strength is essentially fully preserved, and she 
does also retain quite adequate sensory function, I am optimistic that she may be able to regain 
ambulatory status.
Side effects of treatment in Joan's case should be manageable. There may be some possibility 
for radiation esophagitis due to exit dose from treating the thoracic spine; this can usually be 
managed effectively with oral topical anesthetic agents (i.e. viscous Lidocaine) and insertion of 
a planned 5-7 day treatment break in mid-treatment course. With treatment to the chest, there 
may also be some risk for radiation pericarditis and/or pneumonitis; both of these conditions are 
usually responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 
At completion of our discussion, Joan and her daughter expressed their understanding of the 
proposed radiotherapy treatment, its goal of pain relief and prevention of further neurologic 
deficits. Joan did sign an informed consent to receive this palliative mid-thoracic spine 
radiotherapy.
PLAN: Joan did undergo CT treatment planning simulation immediately following our 
consultation. We will be undertaking 3D-conformal treatment planning later today in order to 
design a conformal treatment plan to deliver 30 Gy (3.0 Gy x 10 fractions) to the T6-T9 vertebral 
levels encompassing the left paraspinal mass at T7-T8. Total treatment duration will be two-
weeks, but there is a high likelihood that she will require a mid-course treatment break to allow 
for resolution of radiation esophagitis.

present centrally on the left were much less prominent. Peak Expiratory Flow= 130 liters/minute 
(41% predicted).
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm. No audible murmurs or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Non-tender. Liver span= 8.0 cm.
SKELETAL: There is mild-to-moderate tenderness with palpation about the glenoid socket of 
the shoulder joint posteriorly. No pain on upward percussion of the left humerus. Mild 
tenderness in the mid left femur (~20 cm below the top of the greater trochanter). No other 
significant tenderness with percussion along spinal axis, over the pelvic bones, chest wall 
(including left posterior 9th and 10 ribs), right femur and bilateral humeri.
IMPRESSION: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Freda presents with her first definite manifestation 
of distant metastatic disease, now with progressively worsening left shoulder pain due to 
destructive lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum. She also manifests highly 
suspicious tenderness corresponding to a positive bone scan finding in the left mid-femur (which 
is a ""weight-bearing bone""). 
Detailed discussion was held Freda and her son regarding the indications, technique, potential 
side effects and anticipated results from palliative radiotherapy directed at this left scapular 
metastatic lesion. I stressed to them that her papillary serous endometrial CA has been 
documented previously to be highly radioresponsive in that Joan had achieved essentially 
complete response at the end of 45 Gy pelvic RT, and addition of the ~24 Gy from the Syed 
HDR brachytherapy implant resulted in long-term locoregional tumor control. Furthermore, I 
stressed that since her lower extremity motor strength is essentially fully preserved, and she 
does also retain quite adequate sensory function, I am optimistic that she may be able to regain 
ambulatory status.
Side effects of treatment in Joan's case should be manageable. There may be some possibility 
for radiation esophagitis due to exit dose from treating the thoracic spine; this can usually be 
managed effectively with oral topical anesthetic agents (i.e. viscous Lidocaine) and insertion of 
a planned 5-7 day treatment break in mid-treatment course. With treatment to the chest, there 
may also be some risk for radiation pericarditis and/or pneumonitis; both of these conditions are 
usually responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 
At completion of our discussion, Joan and her daughter expressed their understanding of the 
proposed radiotherapy treatment, its goal of pain relief and prevention of further neurologic 
deficits. Joan did sign an informed consent to receive this palliative mid-thoracic spine 
radiotherapy.
PLAN: Joan did undergo CT treatment planning simulation immediately following our 
consultation. We will be undertaking 3D-conformal treatment planning later today in order to 
design a conformal treatment plan to deliver 30 Gy (3.0 Gy x 10 fractions) to the T6-T9 vertebral 
levels encompassing the left paraspinal mass at T7-T8. Total treatment duration will be two-
weeks, but there is a high likelihood that she will require a mid-course treatment break to allow 
for resolution of radiation esophagitis.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

I  received  a  telephone  call  from  Dr.  Zhang,  who  recently  met  this  patient  for  the  first 
time.  She previously was followed by Dr. Bit-Shawish.  This patient has a diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastatic brain disease.  In late 2020, she underwent 
craniotomy with tumor resection, followed by Gamma Knife treatment under the direction 
of Dr. Flickinger.  She was then given systemic therapy. Several months later, imaging 
studies showed the only residual disease to be located in the right hilar region, also with 
mediastinal lymph node metastasis.  The patient was then given external beam radiation 
therapy  in  a  definitive  fashion,  directed  to  the  right  hilar  area  and  mediastinal  lymph 
nodes.  A dose of 60 Gy was given ending on August 5, 2021.  The patient did not return 
to  see  me  for  up  as  scheduled,  but  had  multiple  problems  and  hospitalizations.   She 
continued with immunotherapy under the direction of Dr. Bit-Shawish.
 
The  patient  had  a  PET/CT  performed  on  December  22,  2021.   I  had  a  chance  to 
personally review those images today.  As noted by the radiologist, there is no longer 
any  abnormal  FDG  uptake  in  the  thoracic  cavity.   This  suggests  a  very  favorable 
response to the previous treatment.  However, there is a new area of abnormality in the 
upper abdomen.  Specifically, there is a 1 cm mass with intense FDG uptake in the area 
of the head of the pancreas or possibly a lymph node.  Dr. Zhang is going to request a 
contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis to try to better delineate this issue.  If 
appropriate, a biopsy might be an option.  I will wait to hear from Dr. Zhang, and can 
also see the patient at a future date if necessary.

DATE OF VISIT:      06/15/2021

                                   CONSULTATION

DIAGNOSIS:  Small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, limited stage.
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.32.
REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Silvia Coleman, Dr. Peter Daloni and Dr. Chad Smith.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Prophylactic cranial irradiation after completion of systemic 
chemotherapy with complete remission.
Ronald Valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 FDG-avid left lung lesions on 
PET/CT scan October 26, 2020.  One is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  On November 23, 2020, he underwent left VATS, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  Pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  Left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  Lymph node study was negative.  Then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  Then, restaging study, April 13th CT scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  MRI of the brain April 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  He is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, VATS in November 2020, tonsillectomy.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, colchicine, Coumadin, COVID vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, Lopressor, losartan, Norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
ALLERGIES:  HE IS ALLERGIC TO ADHESIVE TAPE.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  He drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:  One sister had lung cancer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  He complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
INTEGUMENTARY:  Unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
HEAD:  Unremarkable.
EYES:  He denies double vision or blurred vision.
ENT:  He has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  He 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
GENITOURINARY:  Unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  He has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
ENDOCRINE:  He has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
NEUROLOGIC:  He had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  He 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  Otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
HEMATOLOGY:  He denies easy skin bruising.
LABORATORY FINDINGS:  We do not have a recent blood test, but on November 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, BUN 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated GFR 68.  
WBC 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
IMAGING STUDIES:  I personally reviewed PET/CT scan on October 26, 2020.  MRI of the 
brain and most recent CT of the chest findings are stated in HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
VITAL SIGNS:  He weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
HEENT:  There is no facial asymmetry.  Extraocular movement is normal.
NECK:  There is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
LUNGS:  Showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
HEART:  Showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
LYMPHATICS:  There is no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
RECTAL:  Deferred.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  An 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  Restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by CT of the chest and MRI 
of the brain on April 13, 2021.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

PLAN AND RECOMMENDATION:  Ideally, I would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 Gy, 2.5 Gy per fraction.  However, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  Also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  I would like to leave this issue to 
Dr. Iheagwara.  Also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

DIAGNOSIS:  Non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.

ICD CODE:  C34.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Afaq Ahmad, MD; Steven A Burton, MD; Ranga Patri, MD; Inderpal 
S Sarkaria, MD;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Margaret Umbel is a 55-year-old female who returns to 
Radiation Oncology Clinic for regular followup.  She had 2 radiation oncology treatment one in 
July 2018, stereotactic body radiation therapy to the left lung lesions, 54 Gy in 3 fractions by Dr. 
Burton at Shadyside Hospital.  Then, she developed recurrent/second malignancy in the chest 
in 2018 by PET/CT scan on December 4, 2018, showing left upper lobe, mediastinal, and 
internal mammary node lesions for which she received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, 60 
Gy in 30 fractions, completed on March 19, 2019.  She had a PET/CT scan in June 2019, which 
showed significant decrease of FDG-avid lesions near complete remission.  A repeat PET/CT 
scan on February 4, 2020, shows no evidence of tumor or significant radiation related side 
effect in the thorax.  She does not have fever, night sweating, or weight loss.  She does not 
have unusual headache, osseous pain except for chronic back pain for which she takes 
ibuprofen.  She currently smokes small amount of cigarette.  She uses oxygen when it is 
needed at home.  She has chronic shortness of breath, but denies unusual cough or 
hemoptysis.  She does not have gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptomatologies.  She 
denies visual, hearing, or speech impairment.  She denies gait abnormality.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  She appears to be in good condition, alert and oriented, in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  She weighs 117 pounds, temperature 98.6 Fahrenheit, pulse 102, blood 
pressure 126/68, respirations 22, and oxygen saturation 93% at ambient air.
HEENT:  There is no facial asymmetry.  Extraocular movement is normal.
NECK:  There is no lymphadenopathy in the neck.
LUNGS:  Showing very limited air movement with scattered wheezing, consistent with COPD.
HEART:  Showing regular rhythm without murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Unremarkable.  There is mild punch tenderness in the spine.

IMPRESSION:  Margaret Umbel is doing well, although she has chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease for which she requires oxygen when it is needed.  Today, oxygen saturation is 93% at 
ambient air.  Therefore, we encouraged her to see a pulmonologist and home 
oxygenation/continuous oxygen therapy.  We recommended her to return to Radiation Oncology 
Clinic in 6 months for followup examination.

vibratory and pinprick sensation. 
 
RADIOLOGY:   CT  scan  of  the  chest  done  on  August  11,  2022  shows  no  convincing 
evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the chest.  Mammogram done from 
August 12, 2022 showed no evidence of malignancy.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
 
1.   History  of  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  status  post  recurrence.   Ms. 
Freshwater did have a left upper lobe lobectomy in October 2006 and a right upper lobe 
segmentectomy in 2018. In between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in April 2013 and is status post chemo XRT.  I have reviewed Ms. Freshwater's 
recent  CT  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   The  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and I am happy with that too. At this point in time, I would recommend once 
a year annual CT scan.  I discussed with Ms. Freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  CT  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of Ms. Freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  History of left sided breast carcinoma -- T1b N0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. At this point in time, Ms. Freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   Recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
I have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  I will plan to see Ms. Freshwater back in 1 year.

Tylenol as needed.  She states her headaches happen quite infrequently.  She has no 
dizziness or vision change.  She continues to receive dialysis three times a week.  She 
states  her  appetite  is  good  and  she  is  able  to  tolerate  a  regular  diet.   Her  review  of 
systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
On  exam,  the  patient's  weight  is  147.8  pounds.   No  cervical  or  clavicular 
lymphadenopathy  was  appreciated.   The  patient's  lungs  are  clear,  but  decreased 
bilaterally.  Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The patient had a CT of the chest 
on February 15, 2022. The images were reviewed with the patient and her friend who 
accompanies her to the appointment.  We were able to see the decrease in the size of 
the left upper lobe pulmonary mass as described by the radiologist.
 
The patient is clinically doing well.  We would like to monitor the patient closely.  A CT of 
the chest has been requested in three months.  We will see the patient back in our office 
after the CT to review the results.  She was encouraged to call with any questions or 
concerns she may have.  We remain available to see her sooner if needed. This was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  Dr.  Schocker  who  was  available  during  the  patient's 
appointment today.

DATE OF BIRTH:      01/15/1954
DATE OF VISIT:      05/03/2021

                                   CONSULTATION

REASON FOR FOLLOWUP:  The patient is here for administration of systemic chemotherapy 
as well as continuity of care of lung cancer.

DIAGNOSIS:  She was initially diagnosed back in May of 2016 with left lower lobe poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma with a superior segmentectomy measuring about 0.9 cm, but she 
recently was found to have abnormality in the left lung.  Evaluation again with confirmed non-
small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, not amenable to surgical resection due to the location 
of the malignancy.

CURRENT TREATMENT:  The patient is on concurrent chemoradiations as I agreeable after 
the discussion with the patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Reviewed.  This is unchanged.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a chronic smoker, continues to be actively smoking.  No drug 
use, no alcohol drinking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Also were reviewed and updated.

ALLERGIES:  Reviewed and updated.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient does not have any specific complaint today, although she 
complained of being tired and fatigued probably related to the effect of the chemotherapy and 
radiation.  She also complains of some difficulty in swallowing, most likely due to the radiation 
effect on the esophageal wall.  She was given some medication by Radiation Oncology for that.  
She does not express any concern about soreness in the mouth or any painful swallowing or 
any fever or cough.  The patient denies any dysuria, frequency, or hematuria.  Nausea is 
minimal.  The major complaint is retrosternal chest pain during the swallow most likely related to 
esophagitis from radiation.  There was no any diarrhea or constipation.  No dysuria, frequency, 
or hematuria.  Appetite is fairly okay and weight is stable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, she presented with the following vital signs, temperature 96.5, radial 
pulse rate of 98, blood pressure 123/82.  She weighs 167 pounds, body surface area of 1.9 and 
body mass index of 25.
GENERAL:  She is otherwise looking comfortable without any evidence of physical 
cardiopulmonary distress.  She is alert and well oriented to time, place and person.  Functional 
assessment ECOG of 0.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, anicteric.
NECK:  Supple and symmetrical.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal first and second heart sound.
NEUROLOGIC:  No focal deficit.  No neuropathy noted.  Muscle power normal.
MUCOCUTANEOUS:  Normal.  No mucositis.  No skin rash.
HEMATOLOGIC:  No bruises, ecchymosis or petechiae.

LABORATORY DATA:  The last blood test was done last week Friday, which shows WBC of 
3.5, hemoglobin then was 12.7 and platelet count of 76.  Comprehensive metabolic panel:  
Sodium of 135, potassium 5.4 and BUN and creatinine of 22 and 1.29 respectively and AST and 
ALT were 50 and 21 respectively.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mrs. Carole Gordon is on the last cycles of carboplatin and Taxol 
today.  She will proceed despite a low platelet count of 76.  I will monitor platelet count very 
closely and give her transfusion as clinically indicated.  She will proceed with radiation therapy 
in Farrell this afternoon.  I discussed with the patient also about the role of immunotherapy post-
concurrent chemoradiation, particularly if there is no evidence of residual disease.  At this point, 
the patient has decided not to pursue any further treatment.  She felt that continued smoking 
would possibly preclude to be on maintenance.  So she declined a maintenance durvalumab at 
this point.  Meanwhile, I will continue to watch and monitor closely.  After she is done with the 
radiation, we will schedule for a post-treatment CT scan of the chest in about 6 weeks from now.  
She will continue to have weekly labs until count improved above the danger level.  So 
therefore, we will consider to have blood test done before the end of this week, most likely 
around Thursday.

                          Telemedicine Telephone Visit 

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Michal Krauze, M.D.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C13.8.
 
STAGE:   Synchronous  recurrent  stage  IVb  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  IVA 
squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a synchronous 
diagnosis  of  recurrent  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  IVA  locally 
advanced  hypopharynx  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  had  a  prior  history  of  dual  primary 
stage III non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2018 when he had stage pT3 N1 M0 
invasive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  right  upper  lobe  and  a  second  primary  large  cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma pT1b N0 M0.  He underwent right upper lobe lobectomy with 
an en bloc resection of chest wall ribs 2 and 3, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. At 
that time, he was subsequently followed and no evidence of disease until February of 
2022 when he was noted to have an enlarging right tracheoesophageal groove mass at 
the  thoracic  inlet  with  resulting  horseness.  Additional  workup  including  PET/CT  scan 
performed February 10, 2022, noted an FDG avid lesion involving the right lateral aspect 
of  the  hypopharynx,  the  level  of  the  hyoid,  enlarged  right  level  2  and  3  lymph  node 
lesions as well as FDG avid tracheoesophageal groove adenopathy.  Right upper lobe 
lung nodule and an FDG avid segment 4B   hepatic lesion measuring 3.2 cm concerning 
for metastatic disease.  Additional workup including a EBUS and biopsy of the level 2R 
mediastinal node was negative for malignant cells with scant cellularity.  He was referred 
to  ENT  and  underwent  a  posterior  pharyngeal  wall  biopsy  of  right  posterior  pharynx 
showing  at  least  superficially  invasive  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  a  selective  neck 
dissection  of  right  level  6  contents  showed  metastatic  carcinoma  and  3  of  6  sampled 
lymph nodes with extranodal extension. Lesion in the liver was felt to be too deep for 
biopsy.   MRI  brain  was  performed  on  January  27,  2022  and  negative  for  brain 
metastasis,  initiated  on  additional  systemic  therapy  with  pembrolizumab  and 
pemetrexed,  completed  total  of  12  cycles  of  pembrolizumab  and  pralatrexate  and 
underwent  repeat  imaging  via  PET/CT  on  August  26,  2022  which  showed  persistent 
disease within the right piriform sinus and right neck with favorable response within the 
chest.  Repeat CT chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis on November 28, 2022, showed a 
complete  response  of  his  head  and  neck  lesions  within  the  chest  with  a  stable  7  mm 
right lower lobe lung nodule and response of the previously documented on biopsy liver 
lesion; however, there was persistent unchanged primary tumor within the right piriform 
sinus  and  unchanged  metastatic  right  level  2,  3  cervical  adenopathy.   His  presenting 
symptom was hoarseness, but he tells me his voice quality is subjectively improved.  He 
has difficulty swallowing pills, but tells me is able to eat a normal diet.  He has no taste 
changes or xerostomia.  He presents in Radiation Oncology for discussion of palliative 
radiation  treatment  options  related  to  his  head  and  neck  prior  given  the  favorable 
response noted of his recurrent lung cancer.
 
PRIOR RADIATION THERAPY:  None.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of cerebrovascular accident, on Coumadin. Chronic 
CKD, peripheral artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, history of seizure disorder, 
COPD, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, microcytic anemia, coronary artery disease.
 
PRIOR  SURGICAL  HISTORY:   Transmetatarsal  foot  amputation,  embolectomy, 
thrombolectomy,  left  TMA,  right  VATS  with  lobectomy  and  chest  wall  resection  as  per 
HPI.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Half pack per day smoker x40 years.  Occasional marijuana use.
 
MEDICATIONS:   Cyanocobalamin,  folic  acid,  ondansetron,  amlodipine,  atorvastatin, 
ferrous sulfate, iron, Keppra, metoprolol, Protonix.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI.
HEENT:  As per HPI.
RESPIRATORY: He has never worn oxygen.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented with normal speech and mentation.
 
IMAGING:   PET/CT  scan  obtained  on  February  of  2022,  August  2022,  and  recent  CT 
imaging  with  contrast  enhancement  from  November  of  2022  were  all  personally 
reviewed with findings as per the HPI.
 
LABS:  His last laboratory evaluation was performed on December 1, 2022, showed a 
white count of 9.8, hemoglobin 11.9, platelets 213.  Creatinine 1.23.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (initial  stage  dual  primary  pT3  N1  M0 
adenocarcinoma,  and  pT1  N0  M0  large  cell  neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  status  post 
surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy in 2018, now presenting with recurrent metastatic lung 
cancer  and  second  primary  stage  IVA  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  hypopharynx, 
status post palliative systemic therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab.
 
PLAN:  Treatment options were reviewed, and case and findings were discussed with 
Dr.  Krauze.   Given  his  favorable  response  of  his  metastatic  lung  cancer  to 
pembrolizumab  and  pemetrexed;  however,  with  persistence  of  his  head  and  neck 
cancer,  would  favor  consideration  of  palliative  radiotherapy  to  the  head  and  neck  to 
promote  local  control  and  maximize  his  disease-free  survival.   Acute  as  well  as  late 
potential  radiation  related  side  effects  were  reviewed.  I  reviewed  the  rationale  for 
favoring short course radiotherapy over 5 fractions to improve his tolerance to treatment.  
All  the  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  his  satisfaction.   He  made  an  informed 
decision  towards  proceeding  with  radiotherapy,  we  will  schedule  him  for  CT  based 
simulation and plan to proceed next 1-2 weeks thereafter accordingly.  Radiotherapy to 
be  completed  using  IMRT/IGRT  technique  to  spare  surrounding  critical  organs  at  risk 
including  spinal  cord,  parotid,  oral  cavity,  uninvolved  pharyngeal  constrictors, 
esophagus, cord.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.  I 
spent approximately 25-30 minutes in this telephone telemedicine visit, inclusive of time 
reviewing his imaging, extensive medical records relating to his complex cancer, history 
of multiple primary lesions and discussing treatment options with him personally.

This consultation was provided via telephone between the patient and the provider. 
Verbal consent has been received.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Timothy Burns.
 
DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Brain metastases.
2.  Bone metastases.
 
CODE:  C79.31, C79.51, Z92.3.
 
STAGE:  IV.
 
REASON  FOR  CONSULT:   Dr.  Burns  referred  the  patient  for  an  opinion  regarding 
radiation therapy for her BRA- positive non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Holt is a 50-year-old with a metastatic BRAF-
positive  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases  and  bone 
metastases.   She  was  diagnosed  in  August  2019.   She  was  treated  with  systemic 
therapy  including  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab.   She  has  been  off  therapy  for  over  a  year  without  progression.   She 
received  radiation  therapy  to  L4-sacrum  30  Gy  in  September  2019  and  L5-S1  on  the 
right with SBRT to a dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions in July 2020.  She was doing well until 
recently.   She  has  been  having  increasing  left  radicular  sacral  pain.   The  pain  has 
become  fairly  severe.   She  had  an  MRI  of  the  spine  on  November  8,  2022,  which 
showed bone metastases to L5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into the left S1-S2 
and S2-S3 neural foramen.  There was a possible small focus of nodular enhancement 
in the left aspect of the thecal sac at the level of L1-L2.  MRI of the brain on November 8, 
2022, showed 3 small enhancing lesions consistent with brain metastases including left 
frontal, left parietal and left occipital.  CT on October 19, 2022, showed stable extensive 
sclerotic bone metastases involving the pelvis, T1-L5, sacrum and pelvis.  She was seen 
regarding radiation therapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Advil, Medrol Dosepak, oxycodone, Unithroid, vitamins.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism secondary to immunotherapy.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with endometrial cancer and thyroid cancer.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  Drinks alcohol occasionally.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had increasing radicular sacral pain on the left.  Pain 
has been worse with sitting for long periods.  It is better with standing.  She has some 
fatigue.   She  denied  any  focal  weakness,  bowel  or  bladder  problems,  shortness  of 
breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  
She has some chronic paresthesias.  Rest of the review of systems was negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in NAD.  Pulse 76, respirations 16, blood pressure 
130/80, weight 172 pounds.  EOMI.  No icterus.  ENT was negative.  Lungs were clear.  
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender.  Extremities, no 
edema.   Neurologic,  cranial  nerves  were  intact.   Motor  function  was  5/5.   Gait  was 
normal.  There were no areas of bony tenderness.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  X-rays were reviewed.  MRI of the spine on November 8, 2022, 
showed sclerotic bone metastases involving L5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into 
the left S1-S2 and S2-S3 neural foramen.  There was no high-grade canal compromise.  
There  was  a  small  focus  of  suspected  nodular  enhancement  at  the  left  aspect  of  the 
thecal sac at the level of L1-L2.  MRI of the brain showed small enhancing left frontal, 
left parietal and left occipital lesions consistent with brain metastases.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 50-year-old with a non-small cell carcinoma of the lung 
with brain and bone metastases.  MRI of the brain on November 8, 2022, showed small 
enhancing  left  frontal,  left  parietal  and  left  occipital  lesions  consistent  with  brain 
metastases.  Treatment options were discussed.  She was a candidate for stereotactic 
radiosurgery.  Risks and benefits of radiosurgery were discussed.  She has left radicular 
sacral  pain.   MRI  showed  metastatic  disease  involving  L5  and  the  sacrum  with  likely 
involvement  of  the  left  S1-S2  and  S2-S3  nerve  roots.   There  was  also  a  small  focal 
enhancing lesion in the left aspect of the thecal sac at L1-L2.  Treatment options were 
discussed.   The  L5  and  sacrum  have  previously  been  treated  with  external  beam 
radiation therapy and on the right with SBRT.  The left sacrum could be retreated with 
SBRT.   Risks  and  benefits  of  SBRT  were  discussed.   She  can  also  receive  external 
beam radiation therapy to L1-L2.
 
Total time spent on today's visit was 50 minutes. This included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests  and  time  spent 
documenting today's service.

                                   OFFICE NOTE

 CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Followup hospitalization with diverticulitis.

ONCOLOGICAL SUMMARY:
1.  History of early stage non-small cell lung cancer, resected by Dr. Neil Christie in 2012.
2.  History of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis on bone marrow biopsy on November 29, 
2018, seen by Dr. Roy Smith and Dr. Christopher Marsh in the past.
3.  Neutropenia secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient presents in followup.  He was in the hospital for acute 
diverticulitis.  Recently, we gave the patient Neupogen due to neutropenia and acute 
diverticulitis.  He had a repeat CBC on February 19, 2020, at rehab, Presbyterian Senior 
Medical Center, which showed a white count that was up to 3.4.  He states he will be having 
repeat colonoscopy with GI at Upper St. Clair and potential colectomy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old Asian male who has a known 
diagnosis of stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with malignant pleural effusion.  EGFR and 
ALK, mutation were negative.  He initially received chemotherapy with carboplatin, Alimta, and 
Avastin.  He had an excellent response.  PET/CT scan in July 2013 showed complete 
remission.  CEA came down to 0.8.  He received maintenance treatment with Avastin alone.  
His CEA level went up to 8.8.  Repeat CT scan in January 2014 showed small pleural effusion.  
We restarted chemotherapy with carboplatin, Alimta, and Avastin in February 2014.  He 
developed skin rash, but it was not related to his chemotherapy.  His CEA came down to 1.8.  
He received maintenance treatment with Alimta and Avastin without carboplatin every 4 weeks.  
His CEA level continued to rise again.  In March 2016, CEA level was 5.3.  CT scan in February 
2016 showed no significant change.  Sometimes, CT scans change is proceeded by abnormal 
blood test.  The patient does not want to receive full dose of chemotherapy because of side 
effects.  He was started on new immunotherapies with nivolumab.  He does not have any 
significant side effect.  His CEA level came down to 4.4.

PATIENT ID#:      075609888
DATE OF BIRTH:    03/05/1969
DATE OF VISIT:    10/24/2022

                                   Office Note 

DIAGNOSES:
1.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung, status post radiation, December 10, 2020.
2.  Evidence of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lung via biopsy, December 7, 
2021, PD-L1 of 30%.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Keytruda x11 doses.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Ms.  Smith  is  here  today  for  followup  of  her  history  of 
unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, progressive.  The patient at her last 
visit noted some right-sided rib pain and CT scan done on September 15, 2022, showed 
what appeared to be a new right-sided rib metastasis.  There was an expansile lytic met 
in  the  anterior  6th  rib.   The  mass  did  invade  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing 
multiple hilar structures, which demonstrated re-occlusion of the left superior pulmonary 
vein, though no change in the background pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient in the past 
had been declining chemotherapy.  She has been on Keytruda.  The patient discussed 
starting chemotherapy, Taxol and carboplatin with Dr. Lech at her last office visit, and 
she is here today to start her treatment.  She also was seen by Radiation Oncology and 
is scheduled to have radiation to her rib for pain.  Today, the patient stated she tested 
positive  for  COVID  2  weeks  ago.   She  called  her  family  physician  and  was  ordered 
antiviral treatment, but she was unable to get the medication as it was unavailable.  She 
still  has  shortness  of  breath,  and  initially,  had  a  cough  productive  of  the  neon  orange 
mucus  and  yellow  mucus.   She  continues  to  have  the  cough,  but  no  further  orange-
colored mucus.  She wears her O2 at 5 liters continuously.  She thinks that she fell twice 
in the past 2 weeks, causing pain to her shoulder, to her hips.  Her husband thinks that 
she really did not fall, but somehow tripped or was sleeping and fell to the floor.  She 
takes  OxyContin,  which  makes  her  kind  of  goofy.   She  has  headaches  and  dizziness 
when  she  first  stands  up.   Eating  is  better  and  has  no  further  vomiting  as  she  did 
previously.   The  patient  does  get  occasional  sweats.   She  denies  any  bleeding  or 
bruising.
 
ALLERGIES:  ERYTHROMYCIN, ADHESIVE BANDAGE, PINE OIL, LATEX.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Aspirin,  azathioprine,  Flovent  inhaler,  Humalog,  Imuran, 
ipratropium  inhaler,  Janumet,  levalbuterol,  lidocaine  patch,  lorazepam,  medical 
marijuana, OxyContin, prednisone, sertraline, Spiriva, vitamin B12.
 
SOCIAL  HISTORY:   She  smokes  about  a  pack  of  cigarettes  a  month.   Rarely  drinks 
alcohol.

TIBC 172, ferritin 734.  TSH 1.39.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   History  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung, 
progressive.   The  patient  currently  receiving  immune  therapy  with  Keytruda  and  had 
some progressive disease.  She is to start carboplatin and Taxol today.  The patient was 
seen  by  Dr.  Lech.   In  light  of  her  recent  COVID  infection,  her  increasing  shortness  of 
breath  and  cough  and  anemia,  we  will  hold  her  carboplatin  and  Taxol  chemotherapy 
today.  She will receive her Keytruda today. She will  start her chemotherapy treatment 
with carboplatin, Taxol in 3 weeks as she recuperates from her COVID infection 2 weeks 
ago.  We will investigate coverage for IV iron.  She awaits her radiation treatment to be 
scheduled  to  her  rib  for  her  pain.   All  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  her 
satisfaction.  She is to follow up in 3 weeks or sooner if indicated.
 
ADDENDUM: 
PE confirmed, 
agree with above, 
Ms Smith fatigued, SOB the same-- just over recent Covid infection- I  prefer to wait to 
begin chemotherapy 
for Ms Smith in this case. 
will proceed with IV iron coverage. 
plan for XRT to rib.

CODE:  C79.31.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Plotsko has a history of a metastatic non-small 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases.   He  was  treated  with  stereotactic 
radiosurgery  due  to  10  brain  metastases  in  June  2020.   He  has  been  doing  well  on 
alectinib.  He had an MRI of the brain done today, which showed an increase in size of 
the  old  treated  left  periventricular  lesion  to  2.1  cm  with  increased  surrounding  edema.  
The other old lesions were all decreased.  There were no new lesions.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Denied  any  headaches,  vision  changes,  weakness,  or  gait 
problems.

mucosa to be pink and the airway clear. Oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudates.
NODES: There are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular or inguinal 
area.
SKIN:  No  abnormal  nevi,  ecchymoses,  petechiae,  rashes  or  masses  on  inspection  or 
palpation.
CHEST: Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Auscultation  of  the  heart  reveals  no  murmurs,  gallops  or  rubs.

RADIOLOGY:   CT  scan  of  the  chest  done  on  August  11,  2022  shows  no  convincing 
evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the chest.  Mammogram done from 
August 12, 2022 showed no evidence of malignancy.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
 
1.   History  of  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  status  post  recurrence.   Ms. 
Freshwater did have a left upper lobe lobectomy in October 2006 and a right upper lobe 
segmentectomy in 2018. In between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in April 2013 and is status post chemo XRT.  I have reviewed Ms. Freshwater's 
recent  CT  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   The  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and I am happy with that too. At this point in time, I would recommend once 
a year annual CT scan.  I discussed with Ms. Freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  CT  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of Ms. Freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  History of left sided breast carcinoma -- T1b N0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. At this point in time, Ms. Freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   Recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
I have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  I will plan to see Ms. Freshwater back in 1 year.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds,  no  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
CHEST:  Left-sided MediPort in place.
EXTREMITIES:   No  edema  of  her  lower  extremities.   No  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  No focal neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY  STUDIES:   From  October  4th,  white  blood  cell  count  6.0,  hemoglobin 
8.7, hematocrit 25.4, platelets 188.  Complete metabolic profile significant for creatinine 
of 1.52, albumin of 2.6.  From October 3rd, serum iron 25, TIBC 207, percent saturation 
12, ferritin 242.  B12 and folic acid, and LDH were normal.
 
RADIOLOGIC  STUDIES:   CT  of  the  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis  from  October  10th 
showed no evidence of recurrent disease.  Splenomegaly with a splenic infarction seen 
on CT scan.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  stage  III 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  now  with  recurrence  of  her  squamous  cell 
carcinoma after receiving induction chemotherapy and surgery, status post 4 cycles of 
carboplatin,  Abraxane,  pembrolizumab,  is  now  receiving  pembrolizumab  maintenance.  
She  underwent  CyberKnife  radiation  therapy  to  brain  metastasis,  which  she  tolerated 
well.  She is scheduled for repeat MRI of the brain in November.  I reviewed the CT of 
the chest, abdomen and pelvis from October 10th, which shows no evidence of recurrent 
disease.   She  will  remain  on  Eliquis  for  her  splenic  infarction  and  this  will  continue 
indefinitely.   This  may  have  been  due  to  a  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  her 
malignancy.  She will continue on pembrolizumab without dose modifications.  We will 
continue  with  intensive  monitoring  on  this  therapy  for  life-threatening  illness.   We  will 
repeat  a  CBC,  complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies 
today.   She  will  continue  on  iron  supplementation  daily.   She  will  return  to  clinic  in  6 
weeks.  She will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

cancer with squamous pathology with bilateral neck lymph nodes.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Cycle #12 of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed, so far response 
noted as of August on a PET.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Scott is a pleasant 68-year-old gentleman, who returns for 
followup.   Overall,  he  reports  being  for  followup  after  endovascular  repair  of  left 
iliofemoral aneurysm, which he states he has recovered well from.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Amlodipine,  atorvastatin,  ferrous  sulfate,  Keppra, 
Coumadin, and Protonix.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD and left BKA and PVD.

PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:   Age-appropriate  looking  gentleman  in  no  acute  distress, 
who overall continues to do quite well.  He has recovered from vascular intervention for 
a  left  iliofemoral  aneurysm.   It  is  still  healing  on  my  physical  exam  today.   The  self 
reabsorbable  sutures  fell  off.   There  is  no  evidence  of  any  infection.   The  wound  has 
healed well.  There is a slightly enlarged unilateral left inguinal lymph node that is likely 
related to his recent surgery.  His right sided lymph node is normal.  Otherwise, he does 
not have any neck lymph nodes appreciated, which in the past were enlarged when his 
head and neck cancer was discovered and diagnosed. 
 
At this point, the patient is again due for a reimaging scan, which will be a CT of neck, 
chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  Plan is to see the patient again in 4 weeks 
due to Thanksgiving holiday.  The patient is in agreement with this plan.

                          Telemedicine Telephone Visit 

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Michal Krauze, M.D.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C13.8.
 
STAGE:   Synchronous  recurrent  stage  IVb  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  IVA 
squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a synchronous 
diagnosis  of  recurrent  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  IVA  locally 
advanced  hypopharynx  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  had  a  prior  history  of  dual  primary 
stage III non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2018 when he had stage pT3 N1 M0 
invasive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  right  upper  lobe  and  a  second  primary  large  cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma pT1b N0 M0.  He underwent right upper lobe lobectomy with 
an en bloc resection of chest wall ribs 2 and 3, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. At 
that time, he was subsequently followed and no evidence of disease until February of 
2022 when he was noted to have an enlarging right tracheoesophageal groove mass at 
the  thoracic  inlet  with  resulting  horseness.  Additional  workup  including  PET/CT  scan 
performed February 10, 2022, noted an FDG avid lesion involving the right lateral aspect 
of  the  hypopharynx,  the  level  of  the  hyoid,  enlarged  right  level  2  and  3  lymph  node 
lesions as well as FDG avid tracheoesophageal groove adenopathy.  Right upper lobe 
lung nodule and an FDG avid segment 4B   hepatic lesion measuring 3.2 cm concerning 
for metastatic disease.  Additional workup including a EBUS and biopsy of the level 2R 
mediastinal node was negative for malignant cells with scant cellularity.  He was referred 
to  ENT  and  underwent  a  posterior  pharyngeal  wall  biopsy  of  right  posterior  pharynx 
showing  at  least  superficially  invasive  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  a  selective  neck 
dissection  of  right  level  6  contents  showed  metastatic  carcinoma  and  3  of  6  sampled 
lymph nodes with extranodal extension. Lesion in the liver was felt to be too deep for 
biopsy.   MRI  brain  was  performed  on  January  27,  2022  and  negative  for  brain 
metastasis,  initiated  on  additional  systemic  therapy  with  pembrolizumab  and 
pemetrexed,  completed  total  of  12  cycles  of  pembrolizumab  and  pralatrexate  and 
underwent  repeat  imaging  via  PET/CT  on  August  26,  2022  which  showed  persistent 
disease within the right piriform sinus and right neck with favorable response within the 
chest.  Repeat CT chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis on November 28, 2022, showed a 
complete  response  of  his  head  and  neck  lesions  within  the  chest  with  a  stable  7  mm 
right lower lobe lung nodule and response of the previously documented on biopsy liver 
lesion; however, there was persistent unchanged primary tumor within the right piriform 
sinus  and  unchanged  metastatic  right  level  2,  3  cervical  adenopathy.   His  presenting 
symptom was hoarseness, but he tells me his voice quality is subjectively improved.  He 
has difficulty swallowing pills, but tells me is able to eat a normal diet.  He has no taste 
changes or xerostomia.  He presents in Radiation Oncology for discussion of palliative 
radiation  treatment  options  related  to  his  head  and  neck  prior  given  the  favorable 
response noted of his recurrent lung cancer.
 
PRIOR RADIATION THERAPY:  None.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of cerebrovascular accident, on Coumadin. Chronic 
CKD, peripheral artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, history of seizure disorder, 
COPD, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, microcytic anemia, coronary artery disease.
 
PRIOR  SURGICAL  HISTORY:   Transmetatarsal  foot  amputation,  embolectomy, 
thrombolectomy,  left  TMA,  right  VATS  with  lobectomy  and  chest  wall  resection  as  per 
HPI.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Half pack per day smoker x40 years.  Occasional marijuana use.
 
MEDICATIONS:   Cyanocobalamin,  folic  acid,  ondansetron,  amlodipine,  atorvastatin, 
ferrous sulfate, iron, Keppra, metoprolol, Protonix.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI.
HEENT:  As per HPI.
RESPIRATORY: He has never worn oxygen.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented with normal speech and mentation.
 
IMAGING:   PET/CT  scan  obtained  on  February  of  2022,  August  2022,  and  recent  CT 
imaging  with  contrast  enhancement  from  November  of  2022  were  all  personally 
reviewed with findings as per the HPI.
 
LABS:  His last laboratory evaluation was performed on December 1, 2022, showed a 
white count of 9.8, hemoglobin 11.9, platelets 213.  Creatinine 1.23.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (initial  stage  dual  primary  pT3  N1  M0 
adenocarcinoma,  and  pT1  N0  M0  large  cell  neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  status  post 
surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy in 2018, now presenting with recurrent metastatic lung 
cancer  and  second  primary  stage  IVA  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  hypopharynx, 
status post palliative systemic therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab.
 
PLAN:  Treatment options were reviewed, and case and findings were discussed with 
Dr.  Krauze.   Given  his  favorable  response  of  his  metastatic  lung  cancer  to 
pembrolizumab  and  pemetrexed;  however,  with  persistence  of  his  head  and  neck 
cancer,  would  favor  consideration  of  palliative  radiotherapy  to  the  head  and  neck  to 
promote  local  control  and  maximize  his  disease-free  survival.   Acute  as  well  as  late 
potential  radiation  related  side  effects  were  reviewed.  I  reviewed  the  rationale  for 
favoring short course radiotherapy over 5 fractions to improve his tolerance to treatment.  
All  the  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  his  satisfaction.   He  made  an  informed 
decision  towards  proceeding  with  radiotherapy,  we  will  schedule  him  for  CT  based 
simulation and plan to proceed next 1-2 weeks thereafter accordingly.  Radiotherapy to 
be  completed  using  IMRT/IGRT  technique  to  spare  surrounding  critical  organs  at  risk 
including  spinal  cord,  parotid,  oral  cavity,  uninvolved  pharyngeal  constrictors, 
esophagus, cord.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.  I 
spent approximately 25-30 minutes in this telephone telemedicine visit, inclusive of time 
reviewing his imaging, extensive medical records relating to his complex cancer, history 
of multiple primary lesions and discussing treatment options with him personally.

This consultation was provided via telephone between the patient and the provider. 
Verbal consent has been received.

                                   CONSULTATION

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. David Friedland
 
REASON FOR REFERRAL: Lung SBRT

ICD CODE:  C34.32
 
STAGE:  T1b N0 M0, stage IA2
  
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left lower lobe early stage lung cancer.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Benning is a 61- year- old man who initially had stage 
IIIA non-small cell lung cancer of the right upper lobe.  He was treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, right upper lobe lobectomy with mediastinal nodal dissection and postoperative 
chemoradiotherapy, 60 Gy in 30 fractions, which was completed on October 28, 2016.  He now 
has two left lower lobe pulmonary nodules that are conspicuous on imaging, for which he is 
referred for SBRT.  Regarding his initial stage IIIA lung cancer, he was found to have PD-L1 
expression of 80% as well as C-MET amplification.  In the months following chemoradiotherapy, 
he was found to have 3 concerning nodules in the left lung that were questionable for discrete 
primary tumors versus related to the initial right lung cancer.  Over the past 3-1/2 years, he was 
treated on UPCI 17-121 and had excellent response to immunotherapy with complete resolution 
of a nodule in the left upper lung.  In fact, he received durvalumab maintenance therapy until 
March 16, 2020, when it was discontinued in response to LFT elevation.  On July 14, 2020, he 
saw Dr. Friedland in follow up.  Surveillance CT of the chest and abdomen at that time showed 
no signs of disease below the diaphragm.  There are apparent post-surgical and post-radiation 
changes in the right lung and in the left lower lobe there are 2 nodules that have been followed 
since 2017 and likely represent discrete primary tumors.  I am asked to consider 
radiotherapeutic options for management of these left lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies cough.  Denies shortness of breath.  Denies fatigue.  A 12 -
point review of systems was obtained and was entirely negative.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died at age 63 of lung cancer.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former smoker, history of alcohol abuse.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  KPS 100, seated comfortably in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 72, respirations 16, blood pressure 132/83, oxygen 
saturation 98%.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Wearing a mask over oropharynx.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably in room air.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  No peripheral 
edema.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.
 
IMAGING:  Most recent CT chest from July 14, 2020, shows two left lower lobe nodules, one 
measuring 1.6 x 1.3 cm, which is on series 4, image 100 and then the other nodule measures 
0.9 x 0.6 cm and is at approximately the same level, but more anterior.  These have remained 
visible on imaging since 2017, whereas other suspicious lesions have entirely resolved.  There 
are no suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes nor is there any sign of metastatic disease, nor is 
there any evidence of disease recurrence of the right upper lobe disease.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61- year- old man initially with right upper lobe, stage IIIA 
lung cancer treated with chemotherapy, surgery and chemoradiotherapy, who afterwards had 
suspicious lymph nodes and several pulmonary nodules in question, found on surveillance 
imaging, then received a long course of immunotherapy.  Notably, his PD-L1 expression was 
80%.  Over the last few years while other areas of suspicion have entirely resolved, there are 2 
left lower lobe pulmonary nodules in question for which I am asked to consider SBRT.  We 
discussed that the goal of radiotherapy would be to achieve local control of these pulmonary 
nodules, which appear to be unrelated to the initial disease in the right upper lobe.  I explained 
that SBRT radiotherapy is typically delivered in 3-5 fractions, based on the volume we are 
required to treat as well as the proximity of critical structures, such as the esophagus, heart and 
chest wall.  We discussed that in this situation based on the size of the tumors and the distance 
from the esophagus and heart, I think that his risk of esophagitis, pericarditis and pneumonitis 
are fortunately quite low.  We discussed options available to him, which include observation, 
although after considering the risks versus benefits of SBRT in detail, he would like to proceed 
with radiotherapy as recommended.  I explained the need for a complex simulation with motion 
management in order to ensure that we are delivering the best treatment possible considering 
that these tumors will likely move during the phases of respiration.  We discussed some of the 
technical challenges that sometimes arise from treating 2 tumors in the same organ and we will 
have to decide whether or not to use a 2 isocenter versus 1 isocenter approach.  I reviewed the 
recent CT scan with him in the office and showed him the size and location of the nodules.  He 
understands the specific goals, rationale, risks and team based approach of SBRT radiotherapy. 
I will arrange for his simulation and he will let us know if any questions or concerns arise.

                                   CONSULTATION

DIAGNOSIS:  Small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, limited stage.
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.32.
REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Silvia Coleman, Dr. Peter Daloni and Dr. Chad Smith.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Prophylactic cranial irradiation after completion of systemic 
chemotherapy with complete remission.
Ronald Valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 FDG-avid left lung lesions on 
PET/CT scan October 26, 2020.  One is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  On November 23, 2020, he underwent left VATS, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  Pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  Left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  Lymph node study was negative.  Then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  Then, restaging study, April 13th CT scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  MRI of the brain April 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  He is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, VATS in November 2020, tonsillectomy.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, colchicine, Coumadin, COVID vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, Lopressor, losartan, Norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
ALLERGIES:  HE IS ALLERGIC TO ADHESIVE TAPE.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  He drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:  One sister had lung cancer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  He complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
INTEGUMENTARY:  Unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
HEAD:  Unremarkable.
EYES:  He denies double vision or blurred vision.
ENT:  He has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  He 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
GENITOURINARY:  Unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  He has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
ENDOCRINE:  He has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
NEUROLOGIC:  He had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  He 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  Otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
HEMATOLOGY:  He denies easy skin bruising.
LABORATORY FINDINGS:  We do not have a recent blood test, but on November 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, BUN 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated GFR 68.  
WBC 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
IMAGING STUDIES:  I personally reviewed PET/CT scan on October 26, 2020.  MRI of the 
brain and most recent CT of the chest findings are stated in HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
VITAL SIGNS:  He weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
HEENT:  There is no facial asymmetry.  Extraocular movement is normal.
NECK:  There is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
LUNGS:  Showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
HEART:  Showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
LYMPHATICS:  There is no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
RECTAL:  Deferred.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  An 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  Restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by CT of the chest and MRI 
of the brain on April 13, 2021.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

PLAN AND RECOMMENDATION:  Ideally, I would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 Gy, 2.5 Gy per fraction.  However, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  Also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  I would like to leave this issue to 
Dr. Iheagwara.  Also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

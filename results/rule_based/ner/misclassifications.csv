PATIENT ID#:        075325701
DATE OF BIRTH:      01/15/1954
DATE OF VISIT:      05/03/2021

                                   CONSULTATION

REASON FOR FOLLOWUP:  The patient is here for administration of systemic chemotherapy 
as well as continuity of care of lung cancer.

DIAGNOSIS:  She was initially diagnosed back in May of 2016 with left lower lobe poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma with a superior segmentectomy measuring about 0.9 cm, but she 
recently was found to have abnormality in the left lung.  Evaluation again with confirmed non-
small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, not amenable to surgical resection due to the location 
of the malignancy.

CURRENT TREATMENT:  The patient is on concurrent chemoradiations as I agreeable after 
the discussion with the patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Reviewed.  This is unchanged.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a chronic smoker, continues to be actively smoking.  No drug 
use, no alcohol drinking.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Also were reviewed and updated.

ALLERGIES:  Reviewed and updated.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient does not have any specific complaint today, although she 
complained of being tired and fatigued probably related to the effect of the chemotherapy and 
radiation.  She also complains of some difficulty in swallowing, most likely due to the radiation 
effect on the esophageal wall.  She was given some medication by Radiation Oncology for that.  
She does not express any concern about soreness in the mouth or any painful swallowing or 
any fever or cough.  The patient denies any dysuria, frequency, or hematuria.  Nausea is 
minimal.  The major complaint is retrosternal chest pain during the swallow most likely related to 
esophagitis from radiation.  There was no any diarrhea or constipation.  No dysuria, frequency, 
or hematuria.  Appetite is fairly okay and weight is stable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, she presented with the following vital signs, temperature 96.5, radial 
pulse rate of 98, blood pressure 123/82.  She weighs 167 pounds, body surface area of 1.9 and 
body mass index of 25.
GENERAL:  She is otherwise looking comfortable without any evidence of physical 
cardiopulmonary distress.  She is alert and well oriented to time, place and person.  Functional 
assessment ECOG of 0.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, anicteric.
NECK:  Supple and symmetrical.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal first and second heart sound.
NEUROLOGIC:  No focal deficit.  No neuropathy noted.  Muscle power normal.
MUCOCUTANEOUS:  Normal.  No mucositis.  No skin rash.
HEMATOLOGIC:  No bruises, ecchymosis or petechiae.

LABORATORY DATA:  The last blood test was done last week Friday, which shows WBC of 
3.5, hemoglobin then was 12.7 and platelet count of 76.  Comprehensive metabolic panel:  
Sodium of 135, potassium 5.4 and BUN and creatinine of 22 and 1.29 respectively and AST and 
ALT were 50 and 21 respectively.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mrs. Carole Gordon is on the last cycles of carboplatin and Taxol 
today.  She will proceed despite a low platelet count of 76.  I will monitor platelet count very 
closely and give her transfusion as clinically indicated.  She will proceed with radiation therapy 
in Farrell this afternoon.  I discussed with the patient also about the role of immunotherapy post-
concurrent chemoradiation, particularly if there is no evidence of residual disease.  At this point, 
the patient has decided not to pursue any further treatment.  She felt that continued smoking 
would possibly preclude to be on maintenance.  So she declined a maintenance durvalumab at 
this point.  Meanwhile, I will continue to watch and monitor closely.  After she is done with the 
radiation, we will schedule for a post-treatment CT scan of the chest in about 6 weeks from now.  
She will continue to have weekly labs until count improved above the danger level.  So 
therefore, we will consider to have blood test done before the end of this week, most likely 
around Thursday.

back pain, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss.  She has no other complaints.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please refer to interval history.  Otherwise, complete 10-point review 
of systems is negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 251 pounds, temperature 98.1 F, BP 108/65, HR 94, RR 20, SaO2 97%, 
KPS 90%.
GENERAL:  Stable-appearing female, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Anicteric to clear sclerae.  Moist mucous membranes.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze, rales, or rhonchi.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Ambulatory.
NEUROLOGIC:  A and O x4.  Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact.  No focal neurological deficits.
 
IMAGING AND PATHOLOGY:  All relevant imaging, pathology, and laboratory findings were 
extensively reviewed.  Please refer to interval history for details.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Derrico is a pleasant 73-year-old female with prior history of a 
right breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant 
radiation treatment and chemotherapy as described above as well as a left upper lobe lung

DIAGNOSIS:  Left upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma (adenocarcinoma)

STAGE: cT3 N1 M0.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.12.
 
PRIOR RADIATION TREATMENT:
1.  November 14, 2011, 60.4 Gy in 33 fractions for a right breast invasive ductal carcinoma, 
ER/PR positive, HER-2 negative, Oncotype RS 47, status post lumpectomy and sentinel lymph 
node biopsy and adjuvant TC x4 cycles, adjuvant radiation treatment, and Arimidex for 5 years.
2.  Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel to the left upper 
lobe, left hilum, and subcarinal lymph node, 60 Gy in 30 fractions on April 20, 2021.
 
INTERVAL SINCE LAST RADIATION TREATMENT:  One month.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Ms. Derrico is a pleasant 73-year-old female with a prior history of right 
breast cancer as well as recently a left upper lobe lung adenocarcinoma, treated with definitive 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy as described above, who is presenting today for followup. In 
general, she is doing well.  She had immediate followup imaging with a CT of chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis, which did not show any new areas of disease.  There was a sclerotic area in the T4 
vertebral body; however, per the bone scan, it does not appear to have any uptake and 
therefore not concerning for disease.  She will be starting on durvalumab with Dr. Laubenthal.  
She denies any hemoptysis, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, bone or 
back pain, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss.  She has no other complaints.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  John C. Rhee, M.D.

DIAGNOSIS:  Stage IIIC non-small cell lung cancer of right middle lobe.

ICD-10 CODE:  C34.2.

INTERVAL SINCE TREATMENT:  Three months.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  Ms. Le is a 72- year- old woman with unresectable small cell lung 
cancer of the right middle lobe, which was adherent to the pericardium, initial staging was T3 N3 
M0, stage IIIC.  She initially underwent a right VATS with mediastinal lymph node dissection of 
station 7.  She had multiple lymph nodes positive.  She additionally underwent a left neck level 4 
dissection, 4/7 nodes there were positive, the largest was 3 cm with extracapsular extension.  
Surgery was aborted.  Therefore, the entirety of residual disease was treated with definitive 
radiotherapy, 60 Gy in 30 fractions from January 20th to March 3, 2021.  She also received 
concurrent chemotherapy.  Treatment was well tolerated, but she did have skin erythema and 
fatigue.  She now returns in follow up 3 months later.  Her skin is now normal -appearing and 
her energy level is improved.  She had restaging imaging on April 10, 2021, which showed a 
favorable response to treatment.  She also had a mammogram on May 25, 2021, which was BI-
RADS 2, benign.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies cough.  Denies shortness of breath.  Denies fatigue.  Denies 
headache.  Denies vision changes.  A 12 -point review of systems was obtained and was 
otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  ECOG 1.  Seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.9, pulse 91, respirations 16, blood pressure 109/71, O2 
saturation 100% on room air.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Oropharynx obscured by mask.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably on room air.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.
SKIN:  Surgical incisions well -healed.  Skin erythema has completely resolved.

IMAGING:  I personally reviewed the available imaging including the diagnostic bilateral 
mammogram with tomosynthesis from May 25, 2021, which is negative for masses, 
microcalcifications or architectural distortions.  I also personally reviewed the CT chest, 
abdomen and pelvis from April 10, 2021, which are negative for distant metastases and showed 
interval significant decrease in size of the right middle lobe primary tumor and mediastinal lymph 
nodes, suggesting favorable response to treatment.  Specifically, the right middle lobe mass is 
reduced to 2.2 x 1.4 cm from 4.7 x 3.1 cm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Le is a 72- year- old woman with stage IIIC unresectable non-
small cell lung cancer who 3 months ago completed receipt of chemoradiotherapy.  Restaging 
imaging obtained last month by Dr. Rhee shows favorable interval response to treatment.  She 
continues on osimertinib under the guidance of Dr. Rhee.  I will arrange to see her back in 
coordination with her other visits in about 3 months.  We will review restaging imaging at that 
time.  In the meantime, she will contact me if questions or concerns arise.  We did also discuss 
the COVID-19 vaccine, and I encouraged her to strongly consider this.  Overall, she is doing 
well.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  84-year-old female with a history of deep venous thrombosis, 
status post IVC filter placement, on Xarelto, atrial fibrillation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
prior stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, history of anxiety, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, history of localized breast cancer 10 years ago, who presents for followup for 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially stage IIB disease, now with recurrence in the 
right upper lobe after surgery and chemotherapy.  She developed left adrenal metastases and 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Her tumor is PD-L1 positive, KRAS mutation positive, no other 
actionable mutations identified.  She is on pembrolizumab after completing 4 cycles of 
carboplatin, Taxol, and pembrolizumab with significant improvement in mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy.  She is tolerating pembrolizumab well.  I reviewed the CT of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis, which shows no evidence of disease recurrence.  There was a right upper 
lobe nodule that is stable that we will continue to monitor.  We will repeat a CBC, complete 
metabolic profile, thyroid function testing today and she will continue on pembrolizumab without 
dose modifications.  We will continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-
threatening illness.  She will continue on Xarelto for history of thrombosis as well as atrial 
fibrillation.  She will return to clinic in 6 weeks.  She remains full code.  Her husband is medical 
power of attorney.  She will contact our office with any questions or concerns in the interim.

HEMATOLOGIC:  No purpura.  No petechia.  No prolonged or excessive bleeding.
ALLERGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC:  No pruritus, swelling, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion or rash.
GENITOURINARY:  No dysuria, hematuria, frequency or urgency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, the patient presented with the following vital signs:  Height of 68.25 
inches, she weighs 162 pounds, body surface area of 1.87, body mass index of 24.45, 
temperature 96.4, pulse rate of 90, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure 132/80, O2 saturation 
100%.
GENERAL:  The patient looks healthy, oriented to TPP.  No physical or cardiopulmonary 
distress.
FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT:  ECOG 0.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, anicteric with pink conjunctiva.  No nosebleed or wax in the ears.
HEAD AND NECK:  Neck supple and symmetrical and no JVD.

LABORATORIES:  The post-concurrent chemoradiation CAT scans were reviewed.  It shows 
the following:  The CAT scan was done on the 28th of this month, which was last week Friday.
1.  There are several stable nodules in the left thyroid gland.
2.  Decrease in the mass or adenopathy in the left hilar region with decreased atelectasis in the 
left lower lobe.
3.  Hiatus hernia noted.
4.  COPD with a questionable micronodules.
5.  Somewhat prominent endometrium for postmenopausal palpation.  Ultrasound of the pelvis 
recommended.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN OF CARE:  CAT scan post-chemoradiation appeared to be stable.  
No new findings apart from what was discussed above in the pelvic area.  Although there was 
still a mass or adenopathy in the left hilar region, but it is unclear at this moment if that may 
represent a residual disease of post-radiation chemotherapy changes.  In the light of those 
above CAT scan report I am making the following recommendations:
1.  I am going to schedule a 3-month followup CAT scan.
2.  The findings of endometrial thickening needs further evaluations, therefore I am ordering 
ultrasound of the pelvis.
3.  The patient is encouraged to follow with the PCP, for primary care needs as well as to 
address the issue of endometrial findings.  She may need referral to gynecologist.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Mr. Nebgen is an 84-year-old gentleman seen for his first followup visit after completing 
treatment.  The patient is accompanied to the exam room with his wife. Earlier this year, 
the  patient  was  diagnosed  with  non-small  cell  lung  cancer.   The  patient  had  two 
separate nodules, both in the right lung.  A CT-guided biopsy of a right apical lung mass 
was performed in January 2021.  Pathology showed adenocarcinoma.  On February 20, 
2021,  a  biopsy  was  performed  of  a  right  middle  lobe  mass.   Pathology  showed 
squamous cell carcinoma.  The patient had a PET/CT scan performed.  The radiologist 
described  3  intensely  hypermetabolic  right  lung  masses  consistent  with  malignancy.  
Two  nodules  were  described  in  the  right  upper  lobe  and  one  in  the  right  middle  lobe.  
There  is  no  evidence  of  mediastinal  metastasis.   The  patient  received  concurrent 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  The patient received 60 Gy in 30 fractions.  The 
patient  completed  treatment  on  June  15,  2021.   He  then  began  immunotherapy; 
however, due to side effects, the immunotherapy was stopped.
 
The  patient  states  he  was  having  a  diarrhea  after  receiving  immunotherapy;  however, 
his diarrhea has resolved.  His bowels are now moving daily for him.  He has no visible 
blood in the stool.  He reports no pain in his abdomen or rectum.  He reports no nausea 
or vomiting.  The patient states his appetite is good; however, the patient's wife states 
she has noticed that the patient eats smaller portions of food.  The patient reports an 
intermittent cough.  The patient believes his cough is dry.  He reports no hemoptysis.  
He  has  no  unusual  shortness  of  breath.   He  reports  no  chest  pain  or  pain  with 
inspiration.   He  has  no  headache,  dizziness,  sore  throat  or  difficulty  swallowing.   The 
patient  states  he  was  recently  seen  by  Dr.  Mohammad  Alkayem  and  Dr.  Mehrdad 
Ghaffari.   It  was  confirmed  that  no  additional  immunotherapy  would  be  given.   Dr. 
Alkayem has requested a CT of the chest in 4 months.  Dr. Alkayem will tentatively see 
the patient back in his office on November 17, 2021.
 
On exam, the patient's weight is 141 pounds, which is a 6-pound decrease from the end 
of treatment.  No cervical or clavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  The patient's 
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart has a regular rate and rhythm.
 
I had the opportunity to review the images from the CT of the chest performed on July 6, 
2021  with  Dr.  Schocker  prior  to  the  patient's  appointment  today.   The  radiologist 
described a decrease in the size of the right upper lobe mass and right middle lobe mass 
with  associated  radiation  change.   Short-term  followup  was  recommended  to  ensure 
stability.
 
The  situation  was  reviewed  with  the  patient  and  his  wife.  As  stated,  Dr.  Alkayem  has 
requested a scan to be performed in about 4 months.  The patient is scheduled to see 
Dr.  Alkayem  on  November  17,  2021.   We  will  plan  on  seeing  the  patient  back  in  our 
office after his appointment with Dr. Alkayem.  The patient was encouraged to call with 
any questions or concerns he may have.  We remain available to see the patient sooner 
if needed.  This was discussed and agreed upon with Dr. Schocker who was available 
during the patient's appointment today.

lymph node involvement, hormone receptor positive.  She has been on Arimidex 1 mg 
daily since October 2016, which she is tolerating well.  She has osteoporosis and she 
continues on calcium and vitamin D.  She will stop the Arimidex at the end of the month 
after completing 5 years of therapy.  She will continue with annual mammograms.  She 
is status post left lower lobectomy for a T1b N0 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of 
the lung.  She had a CT of the chest from July 14th, which I reviewed, which showed no 
evidence of recurrent disease.  She will continue to follow up with Dr. Levy and she will 
have a repeat CT scan at her next appointment with Dr. Levy.  She will return to clinic in 
6 months for reevaluation.  She will contact our office for any questions or concerns in

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

REFERRING PHYSICIANS:  Dr. Amanda Laubenthal and Dr. Nicholas Baker.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  
1.  ER/PR weakly positive, HER-2 negative, Oncotype RS 47 invasive ductal carcinoma 
of  the  right  breast,  status  post  lumpectomy,  sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  followed  by 
adjuvant TC x4 and adjuvant radiation treatment 
2. Left upper lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma (adenocarcinoma)
 
STAGE: 
1. T1 N0 M0
2. T3 N1 M0.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.12
 
PRIOR RADIATION TREATMENT:
1.  right breast:  60.4 Gy in 33 fractions and Arimidex for 5 years.
2.   lung:  Concurrent  chemoradiotherapy  to  the  left  upper  lobe  and  left  hilum  and 
subcarinal region, 60 Gy in 30 fractions with carbo/Taxol on April 20, 2021.
 
INTERVAL SINCE LAST RADIATION TREATMENT:  Seven months
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Ms.  Derrico  is  a  pleasant  73-year-old  female  who  had  a  prior 
breast cancer and also recently had a T3 N1 lung adenocarcinoma, who is presenting 
today  for  followup.   In  general,  she  is  doing  fairly  well.   She  does  continue  to  be  on 
durvalumab  with  Dr.  Laubenthal,  is  tolerating  that  fairly  well.   She  has  had  recent 
imaging including a bone scan, which was negative and a CT abdomen and pelvis on 
October 20, which continued to note no changes in her large left pleural effusion as well 
as postradiation changes with areas of consolidation and central air bronchograms in the 
left upper lobe and the lingula.  There are no other concerning areas.  When comparing 
the scan to prior scans, it looks largely like the same standard post-radiation treatment 
changes.   She  denies  any  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  fevers  or  chills,  bone  or  back 
pain, night sweats or unintentional weight loss.  Her breathing has largely remained the 
same.  She has no frank dyspnea.  She has no other complaints.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please refer to interval history.  Otherwise, complete 10-point 
review of systems is negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Weight  235  pounds,  temperature  98.2  F,  BP  117/80,  HR  86,  RR  20, 
SaO2 of 95%, KPS 90%.
GENERAL:  Stable appearing female, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Anicteric.  Clear sclerae.  Moist mucous membranes.
LUNGS:   Largely  clear  to  auscultation  bilaterally.   Some  scattered  crackles.   No 
wheezes or rhonchi.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs or 
gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Ambulatory.
NEUROLOGIC:  A and O x4.  Cranial nerves II-XII grossly intact.
 
IMAGING/PATHOLOGY:   All  relevant  imaging,  pathology,  laboratory  findings  were 
extensively reviewed.  Please refer to HPI for details.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Derrico is a pleasant 73-year-old female with a T3 N1 
lung adenocarcinoma, who is presenting today for followup.  I did review her scans and 
does  continue  to  appear  to  be  more  brisk  post-radiation  changes.   I  do  not  see  any 
necessarily  troubling  signs  in  terms  of  disease  recurrence  or  progression.   However, 
given that this lung reaction is more brisk than usual, I will order a CT scan in 3 months 
without contrast to continue to track this.  Even though she has a pleural effusion, it is 
stable and is not affecting her breathing, therefore, I do not think she necessarily needs 
this  area  to  be  tapped  yet.   In  general,  she  is  doing  fairly  well.   Encouraged  her  to 
continue to follow with Dr. Laubenthal and she may follow up with Radiation Oncology in 
3 months with a new CT of the chest.
 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in the multidisciplinary care of Ms. Derrico.

DATE OF VISIT:    11/18/2021

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Mr. Nebgen is an 84 year old gentleman seen for a followup visit in the office today.  The 
patient is accompanied to the exam room by his wife.  To review the patient's history, the 
patient was found to have nodules in his right lung.  In January 2021, the patient had a 
CT-guided biopsy of a right apical lung mass.  Pathology showed adenocarcinoma.  A 
biopsy was then performed of a right middle lobe mass.  Pathology showed squamous 
cell carcinoma.  A PET/CT scan was then performed.  The radiologist described three 
intensely  hypermetabolic  right  lung  masses.   Two  nodules  were  located  in  the  right 
upper lobe and one was in the right middle lobe.  There is no evidence of mediastinal 
metastasis.   The  patient  received  concurrent  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy.  
Radiation  therapy  was  given  to  all  three  hypermetabolic  lung  nodules.   The  patient 
received 60 Gy in 30 fractions.  The patient completed treatment on June 15, 2021.  The 
patient  received  one  treatment  of  immunotherapy,  however,  had  poor  tolerance.  
Therefore, immunotherapy was discontinued. 
 
Information for today's visit was obtained by both the patient and his wife.  The patient 
states he was experiencing back pain.  He had an x-ray performed at Tyrone Hospital 
ordered by his primary care physician.  The patient was told he had arthritic changes.  
He goes on to state he was seen by Dr. Mohammad Alkayem one day ago.  He was told 
by Dr. Alkayem that he had a compression fracture.  The patient goes on to state his 
primary care physician referred him to a neurologist.  He was started on Namenda.  The 
patient's  wife  has  noticed  an  improvement  in  the  patient's  memory  since  starting  the 
medication.  The patient's wife goes on to state the patient will have an MRI of the brain 
performed in December 2021.  The patient continues to have a cough.  He states his 
cough is intermittent and unchanged.  He has no hemoptysis.  He has no chest pain or 
pain with deep inspiration.  The patient states he has no unusual shortness of breath.  
He has no sore throat or difficulty swallowing.  He reports no headache or dizziness.  He 
states  with  the  exception  of  his  back  pain,  he  has  no  other  skeletal  discomfort.   The 
patient states his appetite is good and he is able to tolerate a regular diet.  The patient's 
wife  states  the  patient  is  not  as  active  as  he  was  in  the  past,  stating  he  is  rather 
sedentary. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
On exam today, the patient's weight is 151 pounds.  This is a ten pound increase from 
his  last  visit  in  July  2021.   No  cervical  or  clavicular  lymphadenopathy  is  appreciated.  
The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart has a regular rate and 
rhythm.   The  patient's  abdomen  is  soft  and  nontender.   The  patient  had  a  CT  of  the 
chest performed on November 10, 2021.  I had the opportunity to review the images with 
Dr. Schocker prior to the patient's appointment today.  There is a decrease in the size of 
the  right  upper  lobe  apical  lung  nodule.  Fibrotic  changes  were  seen,  thought  to  be 
related to the patient's radiation therapy.
 
The  patient  is  clinically  doing  well.   Upon  review  of  Dr.  Mohammad  Alkayem's  office 
note, it appears a CT of the chest was requested to be performed in four months.  The 
patient's wife states the scan will be performed in March 2022.  Therefore, we will see 
the  patient  back  in  our  office  in  early  April  2022.   The  patient  and  his  wife  are 
encouraged to call with any questions or concerns they may have. This was discussed 
and agreed upon with Dr. Schocker.  Dr. Mark Alden was available during the patient's 
appointment today.

PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
CHEST:  Right-sided Mediport in place.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, mild tenderness to palpation in the left inguinal region, nondistended.  
Positive bowel sounds. No palpable hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema of his lower extremities bilaterally.  No cyanosis, clubbing, 
or calf tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  The patient has a palpable right supraclavicular lymph node today.
NEUROLOGIC:   Alert  and  oriented  x3.   The  patient  is  generally  weak.   No  focal 
neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  From November 29, white blood cell count 15.9, hemoglobin 
9.1, hematocrit 28.1, platelets 215.  Basic metabolic profile is significant for a creatinine 
of 0.71.
 
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  As described above.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  63-year-old male, with a history of hypertension, peripheral 
vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, portal vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, who presents 
for followup for metastatic poorly-differentiated carcinoma of the lung with bulky left hilar 
and  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  as  well  as  retroperitoneal  and  inguinal  lymph  node 
involvement  and  skeletal  metastases,  PD-L1  negative,  no  actionable  mutations 
identified.   He  is  on  fourth-line  Taxotere,  status  post  1  cycle.   He  has  declined 
significantly over the course of the past month, and he was admitted for intractable left 
groin pain at the end of November.  He is now on MS Contin and oxycodone, which he 
will  continue,  and  he  will  follow  up  with  palliative  care  regarding  his  symptom 
management.  He is DNR/DNI.  He would like to receive at least one additional cycle of 
Taxotere, even though he understands that clinically he has declined and it is unlikely 
that he is responding particularly well to this chemotherapy regimen.  We will plan for 
repeat  CT  of  the  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis  in  3  weeks.   We  will  obtain  a  CBC  and 
complete metabolic profile today.  He will continue on Eliquis for his history of portal vein 
thrombosis  and  atrial  fibrillation.   We  will  continue  with  intensive  monitoring  on  this 
therapy for his life-threatening illness.  I will plan for repeat CT of the chest, abdomen 
and  pelvis  in  3  weeks.   If  this  shows  evidence  of  disease  progression,  we  would 
recommend  hospice  care.   He  understands  this  and  understands  that  there  are  no 
additional treatment options available for him if he has progression on this regimen.  His 
wife  is  his  medical  power  of  attorney.   He  will  contact  our  office  for  any  questions  or 
concerns in the interim.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

I  received  a  telephone  call  from  Dr.  Zhang,  who  recently  met  this  patient  for  the  first 
time.  She previously was followed by Dr. Bit-Shawish.  This patient has a diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastatic brain disease.  In late 2020, she underwent 
craniotomy with tumor resection, followed by Gamma Knife treatment under the direction 
of Dr. Flickinger.  She was then given systemic therapy. Several months later, imaging 
studies showed the only residual disease to be located in the right hilar region, also with 
mediastinal lymph node metastasis.  The patient was then given external beam radiation 
therapy  in  a  definitive  fashion,  directed  to  the  right  hilar  area  and  mediastinal  lymph 
nodes.  A dose of 60 Gy was given ending on August 5, 2021.  The patient did not return 
to  see  me  for  up  as  scheduled,  but  had  multiple  problems  and  hospitalizations.   She 
continued with immunotherapy under the direction of Dr. Bit-Shawish.
 
The  patient  had  a  PET/CT  performed  on  December  22,  2021.   I  had  a  chance  to 
personally review those images today.  As noted by the radiologist, there is no longer 
any  abnormal  FDG  uptake  in  the  thoracic  cavity.   This  suggests  a  very  favorable 
response to the previous treatment.  However, there is a new area of abnormality in the 
upper abdomen.  Specifically, there is a 1 cm mass with intense FDG uptake in the area 
of the head of the pancreas or possibly a lymph node.  Dr. Zhang is going to request a 
contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis to try to better delineate this issue.  If 
appropriate, a biopsy might be an option.  I will wait to hear from Dr. Zhang, and can 
also see the patient at a future date if necessary.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Nitin Kapoor.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Brain metastasis, C79.31.
 
SECONDARY CODE: Left-sided lung cancer, C34.31.
 
HISTORY:   Lavon  Six  returned  for  a  3-month  follow  up  exam  and  scan  after 
radiosurgery to a large left frontal brain metastasis, small left cerebellar brain metastasis, 
was treated 27 Gy in 3 fractions, finishing September 27, 2021.  In the interim, she was 
admitted for pulmonary embolism in November when she had a scan there and she had 
been tapered off Decadron. Her physicians  saw some edema still present on her scan 
at that time and placed her back on Decadron 4 mg daily even though it was not clear 
there were symptoms related to that.  She just complains of generalized weakness today 
and  has  no  other  complaints.   Her  MRI  scan  today  shows  excellent  response  with 
disappearance of a T2 signal and the left frontal tumor has shrunk down to maximum 
diameter of 8 x 1.3 cm residual with  very limited surrounding T2 signal.  Her radiologist 
did not read the report yet, but I co-registered her images and looked very carefully and 
did not find any additional metastases.
 
PAST  MEDICAL  HISTORY:   Unchanged.   Recent  pulmonary  embolism,  placed  on 
Eliquis.
 
PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:   Pleasant,  well-nourished  woman,  sitting  in  a  wheelchair, 
accompanied by her daughter.  She is well groomed, neatly dressed.  PEERL.  EOMI.  
Breathing  is  clear,  nonlabored.   Regular  heart  rate  and  rhythm.   Abdomen:  
Nondistended.   Extremities  without  clubbing.   Cranial  nerves  intact.   Generalized 
weakness 5-/5 with no focal weakness.  Fluent speech.  Normal affect.
 
IMPRESSION:  Excellent response to radiosurgery.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:   Recommend  a  follow  up  scan  in  3  months  and  stopping  her 
steroids immediately, that should help her regain strength in her legs.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Ms.  White  is  a  62  year  old  female  seen  for  a  followup  visit  in  the  office  today.   The 
patient was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the left upper lung in July 2021.  
The  stage  of  her  disease  was  T1c  N0  M0.  Stereotactic  body  radiation  therapy  was 
recommended to the left upper lung tumor.  The patient received 50 Gy in 5 fractions.  
The patient completed treatment on November 17, 2021.
 
The patient states overall she is doing quite well.  She states she was recently admitted 
with pneumonia, but has made a full recovery.  She states after her admission, she quit 
smoking.  She states it has been about three weeks since she quit smoking.  The patient 
reports  an  intermittent  dry  cough.   She  has  no  hemoptysis.   She  has  no  shortness  of 
breath.   She  has  no  chest  pain  or  pain  with  inspiration.   She  has  no  sore  throat  or 
difficulty swallowing.  She has intermittent headaches that resolve with self meditation or 
Tylenol as needed.  She states her headaches happen quite infrequently.  She has no 
dizziness or vision change.  She continues to receive dialysis three times a week.  She 
states  her  appetite  is  good  and  she  is  able  to  tolerate  a  regular  diet.   Her  review  of 
systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
On  exam,  the  patient's  weight  is  147.8  pounds.   No  cervical  or  clavicular 
lymphadenopathy  was  appreciated.   The  patient's  lungs  are  clear,  but  decreased 
bilaterally.  Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The patient had a CT of the chest 
on February 15, 2022. The images were reviewed with the patient and her friend who 
accompanies her to the appointment.  We were able to see the decrease in the size of 
the left upper lobe pulmonary mass as described by the radiologist.
 
The patient is clinically doing well.  We would like to monitor the patient closely.  A CT of 
the chest has been requested in three months.  We will see the patient back in our office 
after the CT to review the results.  She was encouraged to call with any questions or 
concerns she may have.  We remain available to see her sooner if needed. This was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  Dr.  Schocker  who  was  available  during  the  patient's 
appointment today.

DATE OF VISIT:    05/11/2022

                                   Office Note 

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, ALK positive disease.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Alectinib 400 mg b.i.d., dose reduced due to rash.
 
 
PRIOR ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
-  Presented  with  irregular  menses  for  a  few  months.  Prolactin  level  found  to  be  elevated.  Given  other 
symptoms, including left visual field cut, headaches, weight gain, and weakness, a pituitary MRI was done 
on  9/16/21,  which  showed  2.2  x  1.5  x  1.8  cm  sellar  mass.  Labs  consistent  with  adrenal  insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism, and diabetes insipidus.
- She underwent endoscopic endonasal approach resection of sellar and suprasellar tumor with Dr. Gardner 
on 9/30/21. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma of the lung, with ALK/EML4 fusion.
- CT CAP on 10/5/21 showed 2.4 cm pulmonary mass in the RUL, suspicious mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
and large pericardial effusion
-  10/22/21  PET/CT  at  AHN  showed  hypermetabolic  spiculated  RUL  nodules.  Minimally  hypermetabolic 
subcentimeter LLL nodules. Bilateral lower cervical and thoracic lymphadenopathy. Hypermetabolic activity 
in the right anterolateral 6th rib . Moderate sized non-metabolic pericardial effusion. 
-10/23/21 Started on Alectinib 600 mg BID
- Alectinib held from 11/1-11/5 due to rash. Subsequently resumed on 11/6/21 at reduced dose of 450 mg 
BID.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND INTERIM HISTORY:  Ms. Sarver is a 33-year-
old female without a significant past medical history with recent diagnosis of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the lung with an ALK-EML4 fusion involving pituitary, mediastinum, 
pericardium and lung.  Of note, she initially underwent a resection for what was thought 
to  be  a  pituitary  adenoma  and  was  found  to  be  a  metastasis.   She  was  initiated  on 
alectinib  on  October  23rd  and  subsequently  dose  reduced  November  6,  2021,  due  to 
rash and then continues on alectinib 450.  She continues to do quite well.  She continues 
to  do  aerobic  and  non-aerobic  exercises,  though  her  stamina  is  lower  than   prior  to 
diagnosis. Of note, since her last visit, she was seen by Dr. Jan Drappatz and also had a 
followup MRI, which showed no evidence of recurrence.  In addition, she was admitted 
for a pericardial drain due to persistent pericardial effusion that was done on April 7th.  
Her admission was slightly complicated, and she was discharged on April 10th.  Of note, 
the effusion was chylous in appearance and drained 600 mg of triglycerides greater than 
1200.  She says she felt immediately  better afterwards that she had some improvement 
in her stamina, although she does not feel that she is back to her baseline.  Of note, she 
has gained weight since her diagnosis of hypopituitarism, although her weight has now 
stabilized.   She  has  continued  to  follow  up  closely  by  Endocrine  for  hormone 
replacement.  She, otherwise, denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
palpitations,  dizziness,  headaches,  lower  extremity  edema,  any  new  symptoms  and 
continues to do her activities of daily living and slowly increase her exercise regimen.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   A  comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and 
otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL  SIGNS:   Today,  her  weight  is  actually  increased  to  135.5  pounds,  temperature 
96.9,  pulse  54,  respiratory  rate  16,  blood  pressure  101/62,  satting  100%  on  room  air.  
Her ECOG status is 1.
GENERAL:   She  is  alert  and  oriented,  cooperative.   Mood  and  affect  are  appropriate, 
appears chronological age, well nourished, well developed.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx is clear.  Pupils are equal, reactive to 
light.  No sinus tenderness.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation without wheezing, rhonchi, or rales.
CARDIOVASCULAR:   Regular  rate  and  rhythm.   No  murmurs,  rubs  or  gallops.   No 
evidence of rub.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended.  No masses.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Good bowel 
sounds.  No guarding or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  No visible deformities.  No cyanosis.  4+ pulses.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:   No  tenderness  or  swelling.   Normal  range  of  motion  without 
obvious weakness.
INTEGUMENTARY:  No rashes, scars or lesions.
NEUROLOGIC:  No sensory or motor deficits.  Normal cerebellar function, normal gait.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today is relatively unremarkable.  White count 7.7, hemoglobin 
12.3,  hematocrit  36,  platelets  226.   CMP  remarkable  for  potassium  slightly  low  at  3.4.  
Her creatinine is mildly elevated at 1.3 with a glucose of 66.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  We have personally reviewed her scan and feel that she 
has disease stability and continued response with obvious improvement in her effusion.  
She does now have a read on her CT scan, which appears to agree with a grossly stable 
1.8  right  upper  lobe  nodule,  no  enlarged  thoracic  lymph  nodes  as  well  as  decreased 
mediastinal and pericardial effusion.
 
IMPRESSION  AND  PLAN:   This  is  a  33-year-old  woman  with  recent  diagnosis  of 
metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  involvement  of  the  pituitary  gland,  status 
post resection, resulting in panhypopituitarism, mediastinal lymph nodes and pericardial 
effusion,  now  status  pericardial  drain,  started  on  first  line  therapy  alectinib  in  October 
2021.  She was dose reduced and has continued on 450 b.i.d. with evidence of a very 
nice response.  Of note, her fluid had no evidence of malignancy, but did have evidence 
of potential blockage, and we explained to her that this is not a malignant problem, but 
rather a mechanical problem, which has not been dealt with by her drain, and we will 
continue now with scans every 3 months or sooner if she has any issues.  Of note, her 
creatinine function is mildly elevated today, but relatively stable.  The patient will follow 
up with Dr. Drappatz for regular MRIs as well as Dr. Levenson for repeat echo, return in 
3 months for restaging scans or sooner if needed.  In addition, she will follow up with Dr. 
Fazeli to continue titration of her hormone replacement.  We have again discussed that 
continued treatment is required to prevent progression, life-threatening complications of 
cancer.  We discussed possible side effects of the patient's therapy today and the need 
to closely monitor for side effects through physical exam and laboratory monitoring.  The 
patient will return in 3 months for restaging scans or sooner if she has symptoms.

for immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis.  He has been feeling much better.  His appetite 
is good.  His energy level is moderate.  He has mild dyspnea with exertion, but overall 
his breathing has significantly improved.  He has had no bleeding.  He has had no recent 
infections.   He  has  had  no  fevers,  chills,  headaches,  chest  pain,  cough,  nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  97.7,  heart  rate  56,  respiratory  rate  16,  blood  pressure 
138/88. Weight 130 pounds.  Performance status is 2.
GENERAL:  No acute distress, elderly male, appears comfortable.
HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds.  No  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:   No  edema  of  his  lower  extremities.   No  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  No focal neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY  STUDIES:   From  April  27th,  white  blood  cell  count  12.9,  hemoglobin 
12.7,  hematocrit  38.5,  platelets  208.   Complete  metabolic  profile  is  significant  for  a 
creatinine of 1.42, albumin of 3.2, ALT 75.  Thyroid function testing was normal.
 
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  CT of the chest from May 13th showed a decrease in reticular 
airspace  and  ground-glass  opacities  in  the  anterior  left  upper  lobe,  mild  right  and 
minimal left pleural effusion.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   92-year-old  male  with  a  history  of  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic kidney disease, prior colon 
cancer  status  post  resection,  and  adjuvant  chemotherapy  in  the  late  1990s,  who 
presents for followup for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastatic 
disease involving extensive left pleural involvement and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  
Tumor  is  PD-L1  positive  at  90%.  No  actionable  mutations  identified.   He  received  4 
cycles  of  pembrolizumab,  last  dose  was  in  March,  but  he  was  admitted  after  this  with 
shortness  of  breath  possibly  due  to  immunotherapy-induced  pneumonitis.   He  was 
started on a steroid taper and his symptoms have significantly improved.  He is back to 
his baseline at this point. He has had an excellent response to therapy.  We will plan to 
reinitiate pembrolizumab today.  We will initiate prednisone 10 mg daily, which hopefully 
will reduce the risk for recurrent immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis.  We will obtain a 
CBC,  complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing  today.   We  will  continue  with 
intensive monitoring on this therapy for his life-threatening illness.  He will return to clinic 
in 6 weeks for reevaluation.  He will contact our office for any questions or concerns in 
the interim.

                          Telemedicine Telephone Visit 

Today's  visit  was  conducted  via  telephone  between  the  patient  and  this  provider. 
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to proceeding with today's visit. The length 
of today's visit was between 5 and 10 minutes.
 
Mr. Bowser is a 69 year old gentleman with whom I spoke via telephone for a routine 
followup visit. To summarize his history, he was initially seen in our office in March 2021. 
He has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung that was 
surgically  resected  in  2018.  No  further  treatment  was  recommended  at  that  time.  In 
2021,  routine  followup  imaging  studies  showed  the  development  of  a  left  upper  lobe 
pulmonary nodule. This nodule was consistent with malignancy. He was not considered 
to be a surgical candidate. The risk of biopsy was also thought to be significant, thus he 
was  referred  to  our  office.  A  clinical  diagnosis  of  a  new  lung  cancer  was  presumed, 
stage T1a N0 M0. The left upper lung tumor was treated with 52.5 Gy in 15 fractions, 
utilizing intensity modulated techniques. His treatment concluded on May 11, 2021.
 
Mr. Bowser states that overall his health remains stable since he was last seen in our 
office. He has no chest pain, resting shortness of breath, cough, or hemoptysis. He has 
stable dyspnea on exertion. He continues to wear oxygen via nasal cannula at 5 liters. 
He  states  that  he  wears  this  on  a  demand  setting  typically,  but  changes  this  to  a 
continuous setting with increased activity. He notes that his appetite remains stable and 
he  has  had  no  significant  weight  loss.  He  reports  no  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea, 
constipation,  or  abdominal  pain.  He  has  experienced  no  unusual  headaches  or 
dizziness. He has chronic joint pain, but has experienced no new or unusual bone pain. 
His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
A physical exam was not performed, as this was a telephone visit.
 
A CT scan of the chest without contrast was performed on June 23, 2022. These images 
were  discussed  and  reviewed  with  Dr.  Jack  Schocker  prior  to  today's  visit.  The 
previously  treated  area  in  the  left  upper  lobe  shows  only  a  thin  fibrotic  line  consistent 
with radiation related changes. This represents an excellent response to radiation. The 
right upper lobe nodule noted on his CT scan of the chest in December 2021 remains 
unchanged. These findings were reviewed with the patient during today's visit.
 
The patient is doing well at this time with no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease 
recurrence. A repeat CT scan of the chest without contrast was ordered to be performed 
in six months. He will then return to our office for repeat evaluation. He has no questions 
at this time, but was encouraged to contact our office with any questions, concerns, or 
need to be seen sooner. This was discussed and agreed upon with Dr. Jack Schocker, 
who was available throughout today's visit.
This consultation was provided via telephone between the patient and the provider. 
Verbal consent has been received.

blood pressure 140/80.
EYES: Conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis. Pupils and irides 
are  equal  and  normally  reactive  to  light.  Extraocular  movements  are  intact,  without 
sclera icterus.
EARS, NOSE, MOUTH AND THROAT: Nasal mucosa, septum and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear. Oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudates.
NODES: There are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular or inguinal 
area.
SKIN:  No  abnormal  nevi,  ecchymoses,  petechiae,  rashes  or  masses  on  inspection  or 
palpation.
CHEST: Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Auscultation  of  the  heart  reveals  no  murmurs,  gallops  or  rubs. 
Carotid arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
ABDOMEN:  No  hepatosplenomegaly,  guarding,  tenderness  or  masses.  Bowel  sounds 
are normal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Extremities  show  no  edema,  clubbing,  cyanosis  or  joint 
deformity. No tenderness on percussion of the spine.
NEUROLOGIC:  No  focal  motor  deficits,  no  cerebellar  deficits,  sensation  intact  to 
vibratory and pinprick sensation. 
 
RADIOLOGY:   CT  scan  of  the  chest  done  on  August  11,  2022  shows  no  convincing 
evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the chest.  Mammogram done from 
August 12, 2022 showed no evidence of malignancy.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
 
1.   History  of  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  status  post  recurrence.   Ms. 
Freshwater did have a left upper lobe lobectomy in October 2006 and a right upper lobe 
segmentectomy in 2018. In between, she had a recurrence in the local left hilar lymph 
node in April 2013 and is status post chemo XRT.  I have reviewed Ms. Freshwater's 
recent  CT  scans  and  showed  her  the  images.   The  radiologist  seems  happy  where 
things stand and I am happy with that too. At this point in time, I would recommend once 
a year annual CT scan.  I discussed with Ms. Freshwater that there are potential risks of 
multiple  CT  scans  over  a  period  of  time  including  a  small  chance  for  secondary 
malignancies, but in light of Ms. Freshwater's history of two separate lung cancer, one 
with recurrence.
2.  History of left sided breast carcinoma -- T1b N0, status post lumpectomy, radiation 
and declined hormonal therapy. At this point in time, Ms. Freshwater is doing well and 
has  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  breast  cancer  recurrence.   Recently  had  a 
mammogram that also showed no evidence of new findings on the breasts either.
 
I have discussed the signs and symptoms of breast cancer recurrence including bone, 
brain, lung and liver.  I will plan to see Ms. Freshwater back in 1 year.

HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  BRAF  V600E  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   Of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   Significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  Synthroid.   In  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing Functional Medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   She  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   Her  appetite  is 
stable.   She  continues  to  walk.   She  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  She continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is 
otherwise negative.
 
 
MEDICATIONS:
Acetaminophen Extra Strength (500 mg) Capsule Oral PRN
Advil (200 mg) Capsule Oral PRN

COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (Pfizer) Intramuscular
Flublok Quadrivalent Intramuscular
Multi Vitamin Tablet Oral
Unithroid 1 Tablet (of 112 mcg) Oral daily
Vitamin D Capsule Oral

ALLERGIES:
cats and house dust and mites resulting in congestion.
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  Her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   Her  ECOG 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
GENERAL:  She is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:  Supple, without lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   No  hepatosplenomegaly.   Hyperactive 
bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGIC:   Mild  bilateral  sensory  deficits  in  her  right  proximal  thigh,  left  greater 
than right.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today, her white count is 4.7, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.7, 
platelets are 266.  CMP really unremarkable.  Glucose 104.  TSH today is 0.886.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  The patient did have a CT scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. Of note, on the CT scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   We  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  So this is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  In addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones T1 and T5, which appeared to be stable.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
BRAF V600E mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   The  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  However, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. We may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. In addition, it has been 
a year since her MRI given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly MRI prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  The patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

                                   Office Note 

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  History of adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially 11 cm mass, 
shortness of breath, palliative radiation followed by single-agent pembrolizumab.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Mrs.  Hunter  is  a  pleasant  62-year-old  female,  who  returns  for 
followup.  Overall, the patient so far had excellent response.  Her most recent problems 
were complications related to port placement, which despite changing sides never was 
functional.   Ultimately,  it  was  removed.   The  patient  still  complains  of  right  upper 
extremity pain and swelling.
 
ALLERGIES:  TO PENICILLIN.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Oxycodone,  levothyroxine,  magnesium,  vitamin  D, 
Sudafed, phenobarbital, and nicotine patches.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
GENERAL:  Negative.  Otherwise, right arm pain reported.
Remainder of systems negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  Age-appropriate looking female, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
NECK:  Supple.  No evidence of any swelling, but her right arm looks more swollen than 
her left arm.
LUNGS:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.
EXTREMITIES:  Do not show any edema, cyanosis, or petechia.
NEUROLOGIC:  She is grossly intact.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  Show a creatinine of 1.1.  White count of 4.6, hemoglobin of 
12.5, platelet count of 292.
 
IMAGING STUDIES:  Personally reviewed and discussed with the patient.
 
No definitive change in the size of the paramediastinal right upper lobe primary mass, 
also margins remain indistinguishable from atelectasis, there does not appear to be any 
compromise of arterial supply, progression also in subcentimeter pulmonary nodularity, 
no  new  metastases,  some  clearing  of  radiation  changes.   There  is  a  thrombosed  left 
internal jugular vein noted related to port placement in the past.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   For  this  62-year-old  female,  whose  right  upper  extremity 
pain is clearly related to her right internal jugular thrombosis, we have therefore initiated 
the  patient  on  Xarelto  loading  dose.   Otherwise,  in  regards  of  her  lung  cancer,  the 
patient  was  given  the  option  to  continue  therapy  for  up  to  2  years  if  we  can  maintain 
good  peripheral  access.   Unfortunately,  I  do  not  see  a  way  forward  at  this  point  with 
having  any  ports  placed  in  context  of  thrombosis  and  previous  complications.   The 
patient  is  agreeable  to  continue  with  IV  immunotherapy  administration  every  3  weeks.  
We will see her again in 3 weeks and assess her response to anticoagulation.

PRINCIPAL  DIAGNOSIS:   Stage  III  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  now  with 
recurrent disease after definitive therapy with brain metastases.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  The patient is receiving pembrolizumab every 3 weeks after 4 
cycles  of  carboplatin,  Abraxane,  pembrolizumab.   She  also  completed  CyberKnife 
radiation  therapy  to  the  right  frontal  and  left  temporal  brain  metastases  on  August  25, 
2022.
 
PRIOR THERAPY: 
1.  The patient is status post 4 cycles of induction therapy with one cycle of cisplatin, 
Taxotere and 3 cycles of carboplatin, Taxol.
2.  The patient underwent bilobectomy, right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node dissection in January of 2021 revealing 2.8 cm squamous cell carcinoma of 40% 
viable tumor, 1.7 cm separate adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe, negative margins, 
no  lymphovascular  invasion.   One  out  of  11  lymph  nodes  involved,  ypT1c  N1a 
squamous cell carcinoma, T1b N0 adenocarcinoma.

tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  No focal neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY  STUDIES:   From  October  4th,  white  blood  cell  count  6.0,  hemoglobin 
8.7, hematocrit 25.4, platelets 188.  Complete metabolic profile significant for creatinine 
of 1.52, albumin of 2.6.  From October 3rd, serum iron 25, TIBC 207, percent saturation 
12, ferritin 242.  B12 and folic acid, and LDH were normal.
 
RADIOLOGIC  STUDIES:   CT  of  the  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis  from  October  10th 
showed no evidence of recurrent disease.  Splenomegaly with a splenic infarction seen 
on CT scan.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  stage  III 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung,  now  with  recurrence  of  her  squamous  cell 
carcinoma after receiving induction chemotherapy and surgery, status post 4 cycles of 
carboplatin,  Abraxane,  pembrolizumab,  is  now  receiving  pembrolizumab  maintenance.  
She  underwent  CyberKnife  radiation  therapy  to  brain  metastasis,  which  she  tolerated 
well.  She is scheduled for repeat MRI of the brain in November.  I reviewed the CT of 
the chest, abdomen and pelvis from October 10th, which shows no evidence of recurrent 
disease.   She  will  remain  on  Eliquis  for  her  splenic  infarction  and  this  will  continue 
indefinitely.   This  may  have  been  due  to  a  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  her 
malignancy.  She will continue on pembrolizumab without dose modifications.  We will 
continue  with  intensive  monitoring  on  this  therapy  for  life-threatening  illness.   We  will 
repeat  a  CBC,  complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies 
today.   She  will  continue  on  iron  supplementation  daily.   She  will  return  to  clinic  in  6 
weeks.  She will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Ms.  Horton  is  a  78  year  old  female  seen  for  a  followup  visit  in  the  office  today.   In 
October  2021,  the  patient  was  diagnosed  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  right 
upper lobe of the lung.  The stage of her disease was T1 N0 M0.  The patient received 
stereotactic body radiation therapy to the right lung tumor.  The patient received 50 Gy in 
5 fractions, completed on December 10, 2021.
 
The patient states she is ""tired of being tired.""  She states she is very fatigued.  She has 
difficult  time  feeling  motivated  to  do  activities.   She  states  she  has  taken  Celexa  for 
many  years.   She  also  takes  Xanax  at  bedtime.   She  states  she  has  a  difficult  time 
sleeping.  She states she often feels fatigued in the morning upon waking.  She feels as 
though  she  may  be  struggling  with  depression.   She  also  states  she  has  somewhat 
frustrated by seeing many specialists.  She states she often feels that one specialist will 
adjust her medication.  She will then see a different specialist and medications will be 
changed  again.   She  is  concerned  that  there  may  be  medication  interactions  or  the 
frequent changes in medication may be causing other medical issues.  She states she 
has  a  chronic  cough.   She  has  no  hemoptysis.   She  continues  to  have  shortness  of 
breath and uses supplemental oxygen continuously.  She has no chest pain or pain with 
deep  inspiration.   She  states  she  recently  completed  a  course  of  prednisone  due  to 
worsening pulmonary symptoms.  She states her pulmonary symptoms are managed by 
Dr. Timothy Lucas.  The patient states at times she has swelling in her legs, but states 
the  edema  has  been  controlled  for  some  time.   She  states  she  follows  with  an 
endocrinologist,  nephrologist  and  cardiologist.   She  states  she  is  concerned  that  her 
specialists do not communicate with one another.  She states she would like a referral to 
a  facility  where  she  can  meet  with  all  her  specialists  at  the  same  time.   The  patient 
states her appetite is fair and she is able to tolerate a regular diet.  The patient states 
she continues smoking between five and ten cigarettes a day.  Her review of systems is 
otherwise unremarkable.
 
On  exam  today,  the  patient's  weight  is  199  pounds.   No  cervical  or  clavicular 
lymphadenopathy  was  appreciated.   The  patient's  lungs  are  clear,  but  diminished 
bilaterally.  Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm. 
 
The  patient  had  a  CT  of  her  chest  on  August  30,  2022.   There  was  no  evidence  of 
recurrent or metastatic disease. 
 
The time was spent discussing the patient's overall condition and care.  The patient was 
encouraged  to  address  her  concerns  with  her  primary  care  physician.   For  her 
depression and anxiety, I encouraged the patient to discuss a change in medication or a 
referral to a psychiatrist.  The patient will be due for a CT chest 3-4 months from her last 
scan  in  August  2022.   We  have  requested  a  CT  chest  to  be  performed  in  December 
2022.  We will see the patient back in our office after the scan is completed to review the 
results.  The patient was encouraged to call with any further questions or concerns she 
may have.  She understands we remain available to see her sooner if needed. This was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  Dr.  Schocker  who  was  available  during  the  patient's 
appointment today.

                                   Office Note 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Susan Lehman had lab work done on September 
28.  She has a white count of 2600, 65% segs, 26% lymphs.  She had an ANC of 1700.  
Her H and H 10.8 and 34, platelets 104,000.  BUN and creatinine that day were 9 and 
0.6, calcium 9.4.  She had normal liver function studies.  Her ferritin level was 20 and I 
did start her on ferrous gluconate.  Her B12 was 1077.  Vitamin D was 87.  TSH was 
suppressed at 0.24.  She reminded me that she had had a thyroid biopsy in the past.  I 
do not feel any abnormalities in her thyroid today.
 
She was admitted to Highlands Hospital from September 3 until September 14 for end-
stage  oxygen  dependent  3  liters  COPD  with  an  exacerbation.   She  requires  BiPAP  at 
bedtime, pCO2 on admission was 62.8.  She spent some time in Scottdale Manor after 
the discharge.  She was treated with IV Medrol and tapering doses of prednisone.  She 
was an inpatient at Highlands from September 02 to September 14 and then Scottdale 
Manor from September 14 to September 29 .  She is now on the 10th floor of a high-rise 
in Scottdale.  She has been tested twice for COVID, September 3 and September 14, 
both of which have been negative.  Chest x-ray on September 3rd showed only COPD.  
No infiltrates.  She did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis on September 10th, post-
cholecystectomy, a left renal cyst.  No other abnormalities were seen.
 
We  have  been  following  Susan  for  a  stage  IIIA  non-small  cell  lung  cancer.   Most 
recently, she had been on durvalumab after her Taxol and carboplatin.  The last dose 
was on August 18th.  She started this back on December 29th.  Her lung biopsy of the 
left  lower  lobe  showed  an  adenocarcinoma,  PD-L1  of  10%.   Tumor  was  microsatellite 
stable with tumor mutational burden of 11.  There were no other molecular alterations.  
She had seen Dr. Dan Petro at that time, who felt she had a T3 N2 unresectable stage 
IIIA adenocarcinoma and she was started on weekly Taxol, carboplatin, and radiation.  
The  latter  ended  November  17th  and  she  began  her  maintenance  durvalumab  on 
December 29th.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  She is asthenic.
VITAL SIGNS:  She weighs 87.  Her pressure is 90/51, she is wearing oxygen at 3 liters.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
NECK:  There was no adenopathy or thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  There was no edema.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  At this point, after an interval of 2 months, I have opted to 
take her off the durvalumab.  She has no signs of recurrent lung cancer.  I will see her 
back after the holidays with a followup CT scan.
 
 
The level of complexity was  high and time spent reviewing records, preparing for the 
visit and documenting, examining the patient and discussion with the patient was 45 
minutes. We talked about the current problem, reviewed all of the prior information and 
testing, and developed a plan. The process included a thorough review of the patients 
history and previous evaluations.

HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  BRAF  V600E  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,

trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   Of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   Significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  Synthroid.   In  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing Functional Medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   She  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   Her  appetite  is 
stable.   She  continues  to  walk.   She  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  She continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.

ALLERGIES:
cats and house dust and mites resulting in congestion.
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, her weight is actually stable at 171.6.  Her temperature is 98.2, 
pulse  83,  respirations  16,  blood  pressure  is  118/84  with  a  satting  100%.   Her  ECOG 
status is 1 based on intermittent neuropathy.
GENERAL:  She is a quite well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears stated 
age.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:  Supple, without lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing, rhonchi or rales.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   No  hepatosplenomegaly.   Hyperactive 
bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGIC:   Mild  bilateral  sensory  deficits  in  her  right  proximal  thigh,  left  greater 
than right.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today, her white count is 4.7, hemoglobin 12.3, hematocrit 36.7, 
platelets are 266.  CMP really unremarkable.  Glucose 104.  TSH today is 0.886.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  The patient did have a CT scan, which we have personally 
reviewed and felt that she has no evidence of recurrence. Of note, on the CT scan, they 
did mention a pleural based nodular density in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower  lobe  measuring  0.9  cm,  could  be  inflammatory  versus  needs  to  be  watched  for 
potential  disease  recurrence.   We  have  shown  this  to  the  patient,  discussed  this  with 
her.  So this is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this on her next 
scan.  In addition, she continues to have innumerable sclerotic foci in the sacrum and 
iliac bones T1 and T5, which appeared to be stable.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of  metastatic 
BRAF V600E mutant passive adenocarcinoma of the lung with significant lumbosacral 
disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab,  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical  trial  19-135  that  is  now  over  a 
year  off  with  no  evidence  of  progression.   The  patient's  restaging  scan  today  really 
showed no evidence of progression.  However, there is a small pleural based nodular 
density, which is likely atelectasis.  However, we will continue to watch this and she will 
have restaging scan again in 4 months. We may consider if this is stable or gone in 4 
months to even spacing out her scans to 6 months at some point. In addition, it has been 
a year since her MRI given that she does have metastatic disease, we should be getting 
yearly MRI prior to her next visit and call the patient with results.  The patient will return 
in 4 months for her next restaging scan or sooner if there are any issues.

4.  Denosumab finished 2 years of treatment February 20, 2022.
 
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:

   1. Complaints of back pain and CT scan and MRI of the lumbar spine worrisome for bone 
       lesions.  PET/CT  from  19th  of  August  2019  showing  lesions  in  the  bones.  No  other

HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  BRAF  V600E  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease,  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial  19-135,  who  is  now  over  a  year  off  of  systemic  therapy  with  no  evidence  of 
progression,  who  presents  for  restaging  scans  today.   Of  note,  the  patient  has  been 
doing  relatively  well.   Significant  side  effects  of  her  pembrolizumab,  which  is 
hypothyroidism  for  which  she  is  on  Synthroid.   In  addition,  she  has  had  significant 
metastatic bony lesion from the spine and this did lead to chronic left leg neuropathy for 
which she is seeing Functional Medicine for, but she continues to rehab and appears to 
be  doing  quite  well.   She  does  continue  to  have  seasonal  allergies.   Her  appetite  is 
stable.   She  continues  to  walk.   She  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers, 
chills, headache, blurry vision, cough, pain or edema.  She continues to have left buttock 
and leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Comprehensive  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is 
otherwise negative.

PATIENT ID#:      075609888
DATE OF BIRTH:    03/05/1969
DATE OF VISIT:    10/24/2022

                                   Office Note 

DIAGNOSES:
1.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung, status post radiation, December 10, 2020.
2.  Evidence of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lung via biopsy, December 7, 
2021, PD-L1 of 30%.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Keytruda x11 doses.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Ms.  Smith  is  here  today  for  followup  of  her  history  of 
unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, progressive.  The patient at her last 
visit noted some right-sided rib pain and CT scan done on September 15, 2022, showed 
what appeared to be a new right-sided rib metastasis.  There was an expansile lytic met 
in  the  anterior  6th  rib.   The  mass  did  invade  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing 
multiple hilar structures, which demonstrated re-occlusion of the left superior pulmonary 
vein, though no change in the background pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient in the past 
had been declining chemotherapy.  She has been on Keytruda.  The patient discussed 
starting chemotherapy, Taxol and carboplatin with Dr. Lech at her last office visit, and 
she is here today to start her treatment.  She also was seen by Radiation Oncology and 
is scheduled to have radiation to her rib for pain.  Today, the patient stated she tested 
positive  for  COVID  2  weeks  ago.   She  called  her  family  physician  and  was  ordered 
antiviral treatment, but she was unable to get the medication as it was unavailable.  She 
still  has  shortness  of  breath,  and  initially,  had  a  cough  productive  of  the  neon  orange 
mucus  and  yellow  mucus.   She  continues  to  have  the  cough,  but  no  further  orange-
colored mucus.  She wears her O2 at 5 liters continuously.  She thinks that she fell twice 
in the past 2 weeks, causing pain to her shoulder, to her hips.  Her husband thinks that 
she really did not fall, but somehow tripped or was sleeping and fell to the floor.  She 
takes  OxyContin,  which  makes  her  kind  of  goofy.   She  has  headaches  and  dizziness 
when  she  first  stands  up.   Eating  is  better  and  has  no  further  vomiting  as  she  did 
previously.   The  patient  does  get  occasional  sweats.   She  denies  any  bleeding  or 
bruising.
 
ALLERGIES:  ERYTHROMYCIN, ADHESIVE BANDAGE, PINE OIL, LATEX.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Aspirin,  azathioprine,  Flovent  inhaler,  Humalog,  Imuran, 
ipratropium  inhaler,  Janumet,  levalbuterol,  lidocaine  patch,  lorazepam,  medical 
marijuana, OxyContin, prednisone, sertraline, Spiriva, vitamin B12.
 
SOCIAL  HISTORY:   She  smokes  about  a  pack  of  cigarettes  a  month.   Rarely  drinks 
alcohol.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM:  Headache and dizziness as noted above.  No loss of 
consciousness, seizure.
HEENT:  No change in hearing or vision.  No difficulty chewing or swallowing.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  No chest pain, heaviness, or palpitations.
LUNGS:  As noted above.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  No abdominal pain.  Some nausea.  No vomiting, no diarrhea.  
She gets some constipation.
GENITOURINARY:  No complaints.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  As noted above.
NEUROLOGIC:  Denies numbness.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Weight  135.6,  blood  pressure  120/60,  pulse  78,  respirations  18, 
temperature 96.1.
GENERAL:  Pleasant woman here today with her husband, in no acute distress.
SKIN:  Pale, warm, dry.  No bruising or petechiae.
EYES, EARS, NOSE, THROAT:  Within normal limits.
NECK:  Supple.  No masses or adenopathy.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or ectopy.
LUNGS:  She has scattered wheezes and rhonchi throughout.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Lower extremities, no edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Intact.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today, white blood count 8.8, hemoglobin 8.5, hematocrit 27.3, 
platelets  298,000,  neutrophils  7.12,  lymphocytes  0.6.   Previous  labs,  sodium  134,

ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   History  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung, 
progressive.   The  patient  currently  receiving  immune  therapy  with  Keytruda  and  had 
some progressive disease.  She is to start carboplatin and Taxol today.  The patient was 
seen  by  Dr.  Lech.   In  light  of  her  recent  COVID  infection,  her  increasing  shortness  of 
breath  and  cough  and  anemia,  we  will  hold  her  carboplatin  and  Taxol  chemotherapy 
today.  She will receive her Keytruda today. She will  start her chemotherapy treatment 
with carboplatin, Taxol in 3 weeks as she recuperates from her COVID infection 2 weeks 
ago.  We will investigate coverage for IV iron.  She awaits her radiation treatment to be 
scheduled  to  her  rib  for  her  pain.   All  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  her 
satisfaction.  She is to follow up in 3 weeks or sooner if indicated.
 
ADDENDUM: 
PE confirmed, 
agree with above, 
Ms Smith fatigued, SOB the same-- just over recent Covid infection- I  prefer to wait to 
begin chemotherapy 
for Ms Smith in this case. 
will proceed with IV iron coverage. 
plan for XRT to rib.

PRINCIPAL  DIAGNOSES:   History  of  stage  III  lung  cancer,  2  different  histologies  T3 
N1a adenocarcinoma and T1b N0 large cell, PD-L1 of 20% relapse in form of isolated 
liver  metastases,  too  deep  to  biopsy.   Otherwise,  recently  diagnosed  head  and  neck 
cancer with squamous pathology with bilateral neck lymph nodes.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Cycle #12 of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed, so far response 
noted as of August on a PET.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Scott is a pleasant 68-year-old gentleman, who returns for 
followup.   Overall,  he  reports  being  for  followup  after  endovascular  repair  of  left 
iliofemoral aneurysm, which he states he has recovered well from.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Amlodipine,  atorvastatin,  ferrous  sulfate,  Keppra, 
Coumadin, and Protonix.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD and left BKA and PVD.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
GENERAL:  Negative.
ENMT:  Negative.
RESPIRATORY:  Negative.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Negative.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Negative.
GENITOURINARY:  Negative.
INTEGUMENT:  Negative.
NEUROLOGIC:  Negative.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Negative.
 
Remainder of systems reviewed and negative.
 
PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:   Age-appropriate  looking  gentleman  in  no  acute  distress, 
who overall continues to do quite well.  He has recovered from vascular intervention for 
a  left  iliofemoral  aneurysm.   It  is  still  healing  on  my  physical  exam  today.   The  self 
reabsorbable  sutures  fell  off.   There  is  no  evidence  of  any  infection.   The  wound  has 
healed well.  There is a slightly enlarged unilateral left inguinal lymph node that is likely 
related to his recent surgery.  His right sided lymph node is normal.  Otherwise, he does 
not have any neck lymph nodes appreciated, which in the past were enlarged when his 
head and neck cancer was discovered and diagnosed. 
 
At this point, the patient is again due for a reimaging scan, which will be a CT of neck, 
chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  Plan is to see the patient again in 4 weeks 
due to Thanksgiving holiday.  The patient is in agreement with this plan.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  BRAF V600E positive non-small cell lung cancer.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:.  Active observation with plans for spinal and brain irradiation
 
 ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
 

   1. Complaints of back pain and CT scan and MRI of the lumbar spine worrisome for 
      bone lesions. PET/CT from 19th of August 2019 showing lesions in the bones. 
      No other hypermetabolic area. Myeloma panel is negative. Pt had bone marrow 
      biopsy  and  biopsy  of  sacral  lesion.  No  evidence  of  lymphoma.  Final  pathology 
      consistent  with  mucin  producing  adenocarcinoma,  with  CK7  and  TTF-1 
      expression  strongly  favor  lung  origin,  BRAF  V600E  mutation,  TP53  mutation, 
      PIK3CA mutation, MS-Stable; 10.9 mutations/Mb.
   2. PD  on  dabrafenib/trametinib  (BRAF/MEK  inhibitors)  started  September 
      2019. 
   3. Started  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab  on  6/18/2020. 
      Finished 4 cycles 8/20/2020.
   4. After 4 cycles scans from 8 September 2020 showing partial response.
   5. Started  maintenance  therapy  with  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab  on 
      9/10/2020.
   6. Scans  after  4  cycles  from  November  19,  2020  and  1  December  2020 
      showing  excellent  radiologic  response.  MRI  findings  noted  but  no 
      hypermetabolic activity on the bone scan
   7. PET/CT from 17 May 2021 showing complete radiologic response
   8. S/p cycle #17 maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, 
      Enrolled in clnical trial 19-135 and randomized to stop treatment. 
   9.  On  November  8,  2022,  the  patient  had  an  MRI  of  the  brain  and  entire 
      spine,  which  revealed  a  new  subcentimeter  brain  metastasis  in  left 
      posterior  frontal,  left  peripheral  parietal  and  left  occipital.   Additionally, 
      there  is  an  evidence  of  nodular  leptomeningeal  enhancement  along  the 
      left  aspect  of  the  thecal  sac  at  L1-L2.  There  are  other  osseous  mets 
      demonstrated  in  the  cervical  and  thoracic  spine  without  abnormal  cord 
      signal.

 
HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   This  is  a  50-year-old  female  with  history  of 
metastatic  BRAF  V600E  mutant  positive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant 
lumbosacral  disease  status  post  BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin, 
pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab,  who  has  been  randomized  to  observation  on  clinical 
trial 19-135, who has now been off of systemic therapy for almost a year and a half, who 
unfortunately now has evidence of progression.  Of note, the patient was actually seen 
on October 21, 2022, and was actually feeling quite well.  She had restaging scan that 
day,  which  showed  no  evidence  of  disease  recurrence.   However,  she  also  did  report 
having her chronic left buttocks and left leg numbness as well as occasional neuropathy, 
which is at its baseline.  Unfortunately, she had significant exacerbation of that, which is 
above her baseline and so we recommended getting an MRI of the lumbar spine.  The 
pain significantly worsened and the patient was seen in the Shadyside ED on November 
9, 2022.  She had new worsening left sciatic leg pain with new numbness and tingling in 
her left leg with intermittent left upper extremity weakness.  Her neurological exam was 
actually normal.  She underwent an MRI of the brain and entire spine that unfortunately 
revealed  a  new  subcentimeter  brain  metastasis  in  the  left  posterior  frontal  lobe,  left 
peripheral parietal lobe and left occipital lobe.  In addition, there was evidence of nodular 
leptomeningeal  enhancement  along  the  left  aspect  of  the  thecal  sac  at  level  L1-L2.  
There were other osteo lesions demonstrated in the cervical and thoracic spine without 
abnormal  signal.   She  was  discharged  with  steroids  and  comes  to  see  us  today.   Of 
note, she has not yet started her steroids and continues to have left sciatic pain.  She 
has restarted on gabapentin and has taken one tablet without relief.  She otherwise is 
feeling quite well.  Her appetite is stable.  She continues to walk although now with pain.  
She  has  no  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  fevers,  chills,  headache,  blurry  vision, 
cough,  pain  or  edema.   She  initially  reports  no  weakness,  then  left  lower  extremity 
weakness.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Current  review  of  systems  was  performed  and  is  otherwise 
negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, her weight is stable at 127.7 pounds, temperature 98.2, pulse 72, 
respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 99/60, satting 100% on room air.  Her ECOG status 
is 1 based on her pain.
GENERAL:  She is a well-appearing female in no acute distress, appears of stated age.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:  Supple, without lymphadenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs or gallops.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  No wheezing or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly. 
NEUROLOGIC:  Mild bilateral sensory deficits at right proximal thigh, left greater than 
right, which is stable and chronic.  No changes in lower extremity strength or sensation.  
Of note to palpation, she does have tenderness over the lumbar region.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Today, the patient did not have any new labs today.  She did 
have  labs  drawn  in  the  Emergency  Room,  which  were  unremarkable.   Radiographic 
studies as described in interim history.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 50-year-old female with history of BRAF V600E 
mutant  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  significant  lumbosacral  disease  status  post 
BRAF  MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab, 
randomized to observation on clinical trial 19-135 who is now almost a year and a half 
off therapy, now with evidence of progression.  Of note, she did have a restaging scan a 
couple of weeks ago, which showed no evidence of disease; however, an MRI did show 
both small subcentimeter brain mets as well as enhancement with enhancement of the 
left  aspect  of  the  thecal  sac  at  level  L1-L2.   There  was  redemonstration  of  previously 
known osseous metastatic disease without evidence of progression.  Of note, the patient 
now  has  evidence  of  both  subcentimeter  brain  mets  as  well  as  progression  of  L1-L2 
spine.  We have discussed the patient with Dr. Steven Burton from Radiation Oncology 
who will get her in for SRS for her brain lesions and we are working on arranging for her 
to see another radiation oncologist for radiation of her spinal lesions.  Of note, she had 
previously  had  spinal  radiation  per  Dr.  Igor  Poltinnikov.   However,  she  is  interested  in 
seeing another provider if possible.  We have discussed that after the patient completes 
radiation  to  her  spine  as  well  as  to  her  lung  that  we  restart  systemic  therapy  with 
carboplatin,  pemetrexed,  and  Keytruda  since  she  had  a  long  response  off  of  therapy.  
Initially,  on  her  first  cycle  we  will  give  the  pembrolizumab  only  for  family  reasons  and 
then  with  her  second  cycle  with  carboplatin  and  pemetrexed  for  4  cycles  followed  by 
pembrolizumab maintenance.  Given her extended time that she had response before 
progression,  we  think  it  is  likely  that  she  would  likely  respond  again  if  she  were  to 
progress on this.  Should she progress after rechallenge, she would be a candidate for  
IO-relapse/refractory  trials  as  well  as  potential  BRAF  mutant  refractory  trials..   The 
patient  will  return  in  3  weeks  for  cycle  1,  day  1  and  have  radiation  in  the  interim.  We 
have instructed the patient to take her Medrol Pak and we will decide on further steroids, 
based on her symptoms as well as recommendations of the Radiation Oncology.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Plotsko has a history of a metastatic non-small 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases.   He  was  treated  with  stereotactic 
radiosurgery  due  to  10  brain  metastases  in  June  2020.   He  has  been  doing  well  on 
alectinib.  He had an MRI of the brain done today, which showed an increase in size of 
the  old  treated  left  periventricular  lesion  to  2.1  cm  with  increased  surrounding  edema.  
The other old lesions were all decreased.  There were no new lesions.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Denied  any  headaches,  vision  changes,  weakness,  or  gait 
problems.

REASON  FOR  CONSULT:   Dr.  Burns  referred  the  patient  for  an  opinion  regarding 
radiation therapy for her BRA- positive non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Holt is a 50-year-old with a metastatic BRAF-
positive  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases  and  bone 
metastases.   She  was  diagnosed  in  August  2019.   She  was  treated  with  systemic 
therapy  including  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  followed  by  carboplatin,  pemetrexed  and 
pembrolizumab.   She  has  been  off  therapy  for  over  a  year  without  progression.   She 
received  radiation  therapy  to  L4-sacrum  30  Gy  in  September  2019  and  L5-S1  on  the 
right with SBRT to a dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions in July 2020.  She was doing well until 
recently.   She  has  been  having  increasing  left  radicular  sacral  pain.   The  pain  has 
become  fairly  severe.   She  had  an  MRI  of  the  spine  on  November  8,  2022,  which 
showed bone metastases to L5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into the left S1-S2 
and S2-S3 neural foramen.  There was a possible small focus of nodular enhancement 
in the left aspect of the thecal sac at the level of L1-L2.  MRI of the brain on November 8, 
2022, showed 3 small enhancing lesions consistent with brain metastases including left 
frontal, left parietal and left occipital.  CT on October 19, 2022, showed stable extensive 
sclerotic bone metastases involving the pelvis, T1-L5, sacrum and pelvis.  She was seen 
regarding radiation therapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Advil, Medrol Dosepak, oxycodone, Unithroid, vitamins.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had increasing radicular sacral pain on the left.  Pain 
has been worse with sitting for long periods.  It is better with standing.  She has some 
fatigue.   She  denied  any  focal  weakness,  bowel  or  bladder  problems,  shortness  of 
breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  
She has some chronic paresthesias.  Rest of the review of systems was negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in NAD.  Pulse 76, respirations 16, blood pressure 
130/80, weight 172 pounds.  EOMI.  No icterus.  ENT was negative.  Lungs were clear.  
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender.  Extremities, no 
edema.   Neurologic,  cranial  nerves  were  intact.   Motor  function  was  5/5.   Gait  was 
normal.  There were no areas of bony tenderness.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  X-rays were reviewed.  MRI of the spine on November 8, 2022, 
showed sclerotic bone metastases involving L5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into 
the left S1-S2 and S2-S3 neural foramen.  There was no high-grade canal compromise.  
There  was  a  small  focus  of  suspected  nodular  enhancement  at  the  left  aspect  of  the 
thecal sac at the level of L1-L2.  MRI of the brain showed small enhancing left frontal, 
left parietal and left occipital lesions consistent with brain metastases.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 50-year-old with a non-small cell carcinoma of the lung 
with brain and bone metastases.  MRI of the brain on November 8, 2022, showed small 
enhancing  left  frontal,  left  parietal  and  left  occipital  lesions  consistent  with  brain 
metastases.  Treatment options were discussed.  She was a candidate for stereotactic 
radiosurgery.  Risks and benefits of radiosurgery were discussed.  She has left radicular 
sacral  pain.   MRI  showed  metastatic  disease  involving  L5  and  the  sacrum  with  likely 
involvement  of  the  left  S1-S2  and  S2-S3  nerve  roots.   There  was  also  a  small  focal 
enhancing lesion in the left aspect of the thecal sac at L1-L2.  Treatment options were 
discussed.   The  L5  and  sacrum  have  previously  been  treated  with  external  beam 
radiation therapy and on the right with SBRT.  The left sacrum could be retreated with 
SBRT.   Risks  and  benefits  of  SBRT  were  discussed.   She  can  also  receive  external 
beam radiation therapy to L1-L2.
 
Total time spent on today's visit was 50 minutes. This included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests  and  time  spent

frontal, left parietal and left occipital.  CT on October 19, 2022, showed stable extensive 
sclerotic bone metastases involving the pelvis, T1-L5, sacrum and pelvis.  She was seen 
regarding radiation therapy for metastatic non-small cell carcinoma of the lung with brain 
metastases and bone metastases.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Advil, Medrol Dosepak, oxycodone, Unithroid, vitamins.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypothyroidism secondary to immunotherapy.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with endometrial cancer and thyroid cancer.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  Drinks alcohol occasionally.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had increasing radicular sacral pain on the left.  Pain 
has been worse with sitting for long periods.  It is better with standing.  She has some 
fatigue.   She  denied  any  focal  weakness,  bowel  or  bladder  problems,  shortness  of 
breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  
She has some chronic paresthesias.  Rest of the review of systems was negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was in NAD.  Pulse 76, respirations 16, blood pressure 
130/80, weight 172 pounds.  EOMI.  No icterus.  ENT was negative.  Lungs were clear.  
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender.  Extremities, no 
edema.   Neurologic,  cranial  nerves  were  intact.   Motor  function  was  5/5.   Gait  was 
normal.  There were no areas of bony tenderness.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  X-rays were reviewed.  MRI of the spine on November 8, 2022, 
showed sclerotic bone metastases involving L5 and the sacrum with likely infiltration into 
the left S1-S2 and S2-S3 neural foramen.  There was no high-grade canal compromise.  
There  was  a  small  focus  of  suspected  nodular  enhancement  at  the  left  aspect  of  the 
thecal sac at the level of L1-L2.  MRI of the brain showed small enhancing left frontal, 
left parietal and left occipital lesions consistent with brain metastases.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 50-year-old with a non-small cell carcinoma of the lung 
with brain and bone metastases.  MRI of the brain on November 8, 2022, showed small 
enhancing  left  frontal,  left  parietal  and  left  occipital  lesions  consistent  with  brain 
metastases.  Treatment options were discussed.  She was a candidate for stereotactic 
radiosurgery.  Risks and benefits of radiosurgery were discussed.  She has left radicular 
sacral  pain.   MRI  showed  metastatic  disease  involving  L5  and  the  sacrum  with  likely 
involvement  of  the  left  S1-S2  and  S2-S3  nerve  roots.   There  was  also  a  small  focal 
enhancing lesion in the left aspect of the thecal sac at L1-L2.  Treatment options were 
discussed.   The  L5  and  sacrum  have  previously  been  treated  with  external  beam 
radiation therapy and on the right with SBRT.  The left sacrum could be retreated with 
SBRT.   Risks  and  benefits  of  SBRT  were  discussed.   She  can  also  receive  external 
beam radiation therapy to L1-L2.
 
Total time spent on today's visit was 50 minutes. This included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests  and  time  spent 
documenting today's service.

PATIENT ID#:      075491968
DATE OF BIRTH:    01/16/1967
DATE OF VISIT:    11/03/2022

                                   Office Note 

DIAGNOSIS:   Stage  IV  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  originally  diagnosed  as  a  locally 
advanced adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 at 50% in the past, treated with 3 cycles of induction 
Alimta and cisplatin, followed by surgical resection in April 2019 with path at that time 
revealing a T2b N0 malignancy measuring 4.1 cm with no evidence for visceral pleural 
invasion, although angiolymphatic invasion was identified.  KRAS positive G12D.  PTEN 
positive. TP53 positive.  She subsequently developed brain metastasis and chest wall 
progression over 2 years ago, for which she received gamma knife followed by initiation 
of Keytruda on December 5, 2019 through August 3, 2021, at which point she stopped 
prematurely  due  to  worsening  renal  function.  In  that  regard,  she  has  required 
maintenance prednisone 1 mg daily, which is ongoing.
 
HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   Deb  presents  for  followup.   Since  our  last  visit  3 
months ago, she did develop a cough in September that sounds viral and has lingered.  
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath as well as new bone pain or headache.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   The  remainder  of  her  11-point  review  of  systems  was 
negative.
 
PAST MEDICAL, SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Otherwise unchanged.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL SIGNS:  Stable, afebrile.  Weight 170 pounds.  Pain score 0.  ECOG performance 
status 1.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
NECK:  Supple.
LYMPH NODE:  Negative.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
BACK:  Without CVA or spine tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal and intact.
 
DIAGNOSTICS:   Labs,  October  20,  2022,  white  count  7.6,  hemoglobin  11.8,  platelet 
count 248. BUN and creatinine 22 and 1.43.  AST and ALT 52 and 80 respectively with 
an alkaline phosphatase of 152.  TSH October 5, 2022 was normal.  CEA at that time 
was down to 0.8.
 
IMPRESSION:  Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer as outlined.
 
PLAN:  At this point, I have recommended reimaging based on her cough and I have 
asked her to come to the office after the scan to review results.  I will also repeat labs 
today and if her CEA is stable and LFTs continued to decrease, I will plan followup in 3 
months,  although  she  will  require  BMPs  on  a  every  4-week  basis.   I  will  defer  further 
titration of her steroid dose down as we have been unsuccessful on 2 occasions in the 
past, although she will discuss this further with Nephrology.  I have asked her to keep 
me informed of new bone pain, headache, or abdominal pain in the interim.  Of note, at 
progression,  I  would  favor  a  liquid  biopsy  followed  by  consideration  of  clinical  trial 
enrollment or possibly a KRAS inhibitor.

PATIENT ID#:      075000046
DATE OF BIRTH:    03/28/1960
DATE OF VISIT:    11/29/2022

                                   Office Note 

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  History of adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially 11 cm mass, 
shortness of breath, palliative radiation followed by single-agent pembrolizumab.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Mrs.  Hunter  is  a  pleasant  62-year-old  female,  who  returns  for 
followup.  Overall, the patient so far had excellent response.  Her most recent problems 
were complications related to port placement, which despite changing sides never was 
functional.   Ultimately,  it  was  removed.   The  patient  still  complains  of  right  upper 
extremity pain and swelling.
 
ALLERGIES:  TO PENICILLIN.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Oxycodone,  levothyroxine,  magnesium,  vitamin  D, 
Sudafed, phenobarbital, and nicotine patches.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
GENERAL:  Negative.  Otherwise, right arm pain reported.
Remainder of systems negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  Age-appropriate looking female, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
NECK:  Supple.  No evidence of any swelling, but her right arm looks more swollen than 
her left arm.
LUNGS:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.
EXTREMITIES:  Do not show any edema, cyanosis, or petechia.
NEUROLOGIC:  She is grossly intact.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  Show a creatinine of 1.1.  White count of 4.6, hemoglobin of 
12.5, platelet count of 292.
 
IMAGING STUDIES:  Personally reviewed and discussed with the patient.
 
No definitive change in the size of the paramediastinal right upper lobe primary mass, 
also margins remain indistinguishable from atelectasis, there does not appear to be any 
compromise of arterial supply, progression also in subcentimeter pulmonary nodularity, 
no  new  metastases,  some  clearing  of  radiation  changes.   There  is  a  thrombosed  left 
internal jugular vein noted related to port placement in the past.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   For  this  62-year-old  female,  whose  right  upper  extremity 
pain is clearly related to her right internal jugular thrombosis, we have therefore initiated 
the  patient  on  Xarelto  loading  dose.   Otherwise,  in  regards  of  her  lung  cancer,  the 
patient  was  given  the  option  to  continue  therapy  for  up  to  2  years  if  we  can  maintain 
good  peripheral  access.   Unfortunately,  I  do  not  see  a  way  forward  at  this  point  with 
having  any  ports  placed  in  context  of  thrombosis  and  previous  complications.   The 
patient  is  agreeable  to  continue  with  IV  immunotherapy  administration  every  3  weeks.  
We will see her again in 3 weeks and assess her response to anticoagulation.

history  of  adenocarcinoma  and  large  cell  neuroendocrine  carcinoma  noted  as  well  as 
history  of  recently  diagnosed  locally  advanced  head  and  neck  cancer  with  positive 
bilateral neck lymph nodes.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  cycle #13 of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Mr.  Scott  is  a  pleasant  68-year-old  gentleman,  who  overall 
continues to do well.  I was recently contacted by his dentist that the patient is in need of 
having  some  teeth  pulled.   Otherwise,  he  also  had  recently  endovascular  repair  of  an 
iliac aneurysm on the left.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Amlodipine,  atorvastatin,  ferrous  sulfate,  Keppra, 
Coumadin, and Protonix.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD, left BKA as well as peripheral vascular disease.

stable  7  mm  right  lower  lobe  nodule.   Otherwise,  CT  of  the  chest  shows  persistent 
unchanged primary tumor from the right piriform sinus.  There is no interval progression 
of the primary tumor.  Unchanged metastatic right cervical lymphadenopathy.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   For  this  68-year-old  gentleman  overall  had  excellent 
response with chemoimmunotherapy to his lung cancer part.  In regards of his head and 
neck  cancer,  I  have  discussed  with  the  patient  and  I  would  like  him  to  be  seen  by 
Radiation Oncology for possible radiation evaluation, especially since his lung cancer is 
no longer the primary problem.  I have also contacted Dr. Vargo in patient's case.  We 
will see the patient again in 3 weeks and discuss recommendation.  Otherwise, in the

                                   Office Note 

REASON FOR VISIT:  Followup of squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung.
 
HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   In  November  2021,  the  patient  was  sent  for  a 
screening  chest  CT  due  to  his  smoking  history.   This  revealed  a  4.9  x  6.6  cm  right 
infrahilar mass with probable right hilar adenopathy.  PET scan in December revealed 
uptake in the right lower lobe extending into the right hilum without hilar or mediastinal 
adenopathy.   Brain  MRI  was  negative.   In  January  2022,  he  underwent  right  lower 
lobectomy  with  wedge  resection  of  the  right  middle  lobe  and  lymph  node  sampling.  
Pathology  revealed  keratinizing  squamous  cell  carcinoma.   Tumor  measured  6.8  cm.  
Angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion were seen.  One out of 11 N1 nodes were 
positive.  Middle lobe wedge resection also revealed a 1.8 cm squamous cell carcinoma 
with 1/3 positive nodes.  There were 2 squamous cell carcinomas, one in the right lower 
lobe and one in the right middle lobe, but based on the morphologic findings, these were 
felt to represent the same tumor.  PD-L1 was 60%.  Margins were negative.  He was 
staged as T4 N1 M0 disease with a complete resection.  He was subsequently treated 
with adjuvant Taxotere/cisplatin through May 2022.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Smith comes in today for followup.  This is actually the first 
time  I  have  seen  him  since  June.   At  that  time,  he  was  planning  to  relocate  to  New 
Jersey.   He  had  a  PET  scan  ordered  shortly  after  that  visit  and  then  a  followup 
scheduled with his chest surgeon.  He followed up with them, as noted, plans were that 
he was going to move to New Jersey, recommendations from chest surgery locally with 
that he establish care, but it sounds like he never did relocate.  He then followed up with 
some  imaging  in  October,  he  was  seen  by  Thoracic  Surgery  in  September,  they 
recommended  a  followup  PET  scan,  which  unfortunately  revealed  that  a  mass  in  the 
right  lung  had  now  significantly  increased  in  size  measuring  2.25  x  10.68  cm.   He 
underwent  a  biopsy  on  October  24th,  which  revealed  metastatic  squamous  cell 
carcinoma.  TPS was 3% as far as his PD-L1.  He now comes in today for discussion of 
further therapy.  He is understandably depressed by the diagnosis.  He tells me he is 
having  no  problems  with  fevers,  chills,  nausea,  or  vomiting.   He  denies  blood  in  the 
bowels or in the urine.  He does have a cough and tells me he does cough up blood on 
occasion.  He denies headaches, dizzy spells, or fainting spells.  He denies any focal 
neurologic deficits.  He denies any new bone or joint pain.  His appetite is fair.  All other 
systems were reviewed with the patient and are negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished African American male in no acute distress.
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  97.0,  heart  rate  88,  respiratory  rate  20,  blood  pressure 
138/86, weight 238.2 pounds, which is up 6.2 pounds.
HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  No 
scleral  icterus.   Oropharynx  is  moist  and  pink  without  tonsillar  erythema  or  exudate.  
There is no thrush and there are no mouth ulcers.
NECK:  No JVD or thyromegaly.
NODES:  No anterior cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary adenopathy palpable.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Scattered rhonchi.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds,  no 
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No cords or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.
SKIN:  No rash or petechiae.
 
LABORATORY  DATA  AND  IMAGING:   PET  scan  results  and  biopsy  results  are  as 
noted above.
 
ASSESSMENT:   A  57-year-old  African  American  male  with  a  history  of  a  T4  N1  M0 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, status post resection followed by adjuvant therapy.  
Followup  imaging  in  June  revealed  a  small  new  PET-avid  lesion.   However,  he  was 
moving to New Jersey at that time and it looks like this was going to be addressed by his 
new doctors.  It looks like he never did relocate and subsequently was found in October 
to have significant progression of disease.  Biopsy has confirmed recurrent disease.
 
PLAN:  Mr. Smith and I had a long talk today about his diagnosis.  I told him I am of the 
opinion, we should try to treat him aggressively.  His PET scan does not show disease 
elsewhere, so I am inclined to treat this as a local recurrence or oligometastatic focus 
and  see  if  chemoradiotherapy  could  be  an  option.   I  have  referred  him  to  Radiation 
Oncology, they have been kind enough to see him today and I already spoke with Dr. 
Dougherty, who also feels that we probably could do combined chemoradiotherapy for 
definitive treatment.  I am going to set another CAT scan up for Mr. Smith just to make 
sure no new disease has turned up elsewhere, which might change our treatment plans.  
We  will  plan  on  moving  ahead  with  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  with  radiation  assuming 
there is no metastatic disease and I will see him when the treatment starts.

PRINCIPAL  DIAGNOSIS:   Metastatic  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain 
metastases.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  The patient is receiving pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.  She is 
status post 4 cycles of carboplatin, Abraxane, pembrolizumab.
 
PRIOR THERAPY:  
1.  The patient received 4 cycles of induction therapy with 1 cycle of cisplatin, Taxotere, 
and 3 cycles of carboplatin and Taxol for stage III disease.
2.  The patient underwent bilobectomy right middle lobe and right lower lobe and lymph 
node  dissection  in  January  2021  revealing  2.8  cm  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  40% 
viable tumor, 1.7 cm separate adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe, negative margins, 
no  lymphovascular  invasion,  1/11  lymph  nodes  involved,  ypT1c  N1a  squamous  cell 
carcinoma, T1b N0 adenocarcinoma.
3.   The  patient  had  disease  progression  on  bronchoscopy.   Endobronchial  ultrasound 
and biopsy of a right hilar mass showed recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.
4.  The patient received CyberKnife radiation therapy to the right frontal and left temporal 
brain metastasis in August of 2022.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Ativan p.r.n., folic acid, Norco p.r.n., Plaquenil, magnesium, 
metoprolol,  omeprazole,  clonazepam  p.r.n.,  Eliquis,  prednisone,  iron  sulfate  325  mg 
daily, and she is on a steroid taper.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  She 
was last seen on October 20, 2022.  Since that time, she continued on pembrolizumab.  
She also received a dose of Zometa on October 21st for hypercalcemia.  Her appetite is 
good.  Her energy level is moderate.  She has some intermittent dyspnea with exertion.  
She has some diffuse arthritis, which has been worse over the past few weeks and she 
was started on a steroid taper by her rheumatologist this week with some improvement.  
She has had no bleeding.  She has had no recent infections.  She has had no fevers, 
chills,  headaches,  chest  pain,  cough,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  constipation, 
abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  97.7,  heart  rate  54,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
138/98, weight 140 pounds.  Performance status is 1.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress, comfortable.
HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds.   No  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
CHEST:  Left-sided MediPort in place.
EXTREMITIES:   No  edema  of  her  lower  extremities.   No  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  No focal neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  From October 20th, white blood cell count 5.1, hemoglobin 
11.0,  hematocrit  32.1,  platelets  170.   Thyroid  function  testing  was  normal.   From 
November 10th, basic metabolic profile is significant for a creatinine 1.76, calcium 8.7.
 
RADIOLOGIC  STUDIES:   MRI  of  the  brain  from  November  30th  showed  stable  to 
minimally increased size of left temporal ring-enhancing metastasis, punctate metastasis 
in the posterior left temporal lobe is new, new left frontal opercular metastasis, and the 
right frontal opercular punctate metastasis seen in August is barely perceptible on the 
current study.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  She initially had stage III 
disease  and  she  had  recurrence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  after  receiving  induction 
chemotherapy  and  surgery.   She  is  status  post  carboplatin,  Abraxane,  and 
pembrolizumab  chemoimmunotherapy  for  4  cycles,  and  she  is  now  receiving 
pembrolizumab maintenance.  She underwent CyberKnife radiation therapy to the brain 
metastases  in  August.   I  reviewed  her  MRI  of  the  brain  from  yesterday,  which  shows 
possibly 2 new areas of brain metastases.  She has an appointment to see Dr. Burton 
next week and I will contact him regarding the results of the MRI of the brain.  For now, 
she  will  continue  on  pembrolizumab  without  dose  modifications.   We  will  plan  for 
restaging  CT  of  the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  in  6  weeks.   We  will  obtain  a  CBC, 
complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies  today.   We  will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  She has 
hypercalcemia associated with malignancy and she will have a repeat basic metabolic 
profile  in  3  weeks  and  we  will  administer  additional  Zometa  as  necessary.   She  will 
continue  on  iron  sulfate  daily.   She  will  continue  on  Eliquis  for  her  recent  splenic 
infarction,  which  is  likely  related  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.  
She will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  97.7,  heart  rate  54,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
138/98, weight 140 pounds.  Performance status is 1.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress, comfortable.
HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds.   No  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
CHEST:  Left-sided MediPort in place.
EXTREMITIES:   No  edema  of  her  lower  extremities.   No  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  From October 20th, white blood cell count 5.1, hemoglobin 
11.0,  hematocrit  32.1,  platelets  170.   Thyroid  function  testing  was  normal.   From 
November 10th, basic metabolic profile is significant for a creatinine 1.76, calcium 8.7.
 
RADIOLOGIC  STUDIES:   MRI  of  the  brain  from  November  30th  showed  stable  to 
minimally increased size of left temporal ring-enhancing metastasis, punctate metastasis 
in the posterior left temporal lobe is new, new left frontal opercular metastasis, and the 
right frontal opercular punctate metastasis seen in August is barely perceptible on the 
current study.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  61-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, 
arthritis,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  who  presents  for  followup  for  metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with brain metastases.  She initially had stage III 
disease  and  she  had  recurrence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  after  receiving  induction 
chemotherapy  and  surgery.   She  is  status  post  carboplatin,  Abraxane,  and 
pembrolizumab  chemoimmunotherapy  for  4  cycles,  and  she  is  now  receiving 
pembrolizumab maintenance.  She underwent CyberKnife radiation therapy to the brain 
metastases  in  August.   I  reviewed  her  MRI  of  the  brain  from  yesterday,  which  shows 
possibly 2 new areas of brain metastases.  She has an appointment to see Dr. Burton 
next week and I will contact him regarding the results of the MRI of the brain.  For now, 
she  will  continue  on  pembrolizumab  without  dose  modifications.   We  will  plan  for 
restaging  CT  of  the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  in  6  weeks.   We  will  obtain  a  CBC, 
complete  metabolic  profile,  thyroid  function  testing,  and  iron  studies  today.   We  will 
continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for life-threatening illness.  She has 
hypercalcemia associated with malignancy and she will have a repeat basic metabolic 
profile  in  3  weeks  and  we  will  administer  additional  Zometa  as  necessary.   She  will 
continue  on  iron  sulfate  daily.   She  will  continue  on  Eliquis  for  her  recent  splenic 
infarction,  which  is  likely  related  to  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  malignancy.  
She will contact our office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

HISTORY  OF  PRESENT  ILLNESS:   Marcia  McKee  is  a  pleasant  lady  with  history  of 
very  poor  lung  function,  significant  emphysema,  original  diagnosis  of  lung  cancer, 
squamous cell lung cancer in 2017 and she is status post radiation to the right side.  She 
was  diagnosed  with  it  when  she  presented  with  chest  pain  and  had  a  chest  x-ray.   It 
showed a right sided nodule.  She had a repeat chest CT, which showed a nodule at the 
site of radiation and 2 other nodules.  She had a PET scan and she was following up 
with us on a regular basis.  Lost to follow up after December 2020 and then did not come 
back until 2022.  Dr. Pendleton ordered a CAT scan, which did show some new findings 
and we sent her to Dr. Wilhite, but she was not too thrilled to travel to Pittsburgh and so 
she did see Dr. Chitti and she was supposed to get radiation, but she never showed up 
for  radiation  because  of  apparent  bronchitis,  etc.   She  has  not  started  any  treatment.  
She presents today for followup.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
CONSTITUTIONAL:  Negative.
CARDIAC: Negative.
 
Remainder of the 14-point review of systems negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today is otherwise negative.
GENERAL: Not in any distress, looks well. 
HEENT: PERRLA. Normal oral cavity. 
NECK: No JVD. No lymphadenopathy.
HEART: S1, S2 heard. No rubs. No murmur. 
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation, equal air entry. 
ABDOMEN: Soft. No tenderness, no distension. 
EXTREMITIES: No edema. Pulses felt.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed.  They are within normal limits.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:    Ms.  Marcia  McKee  is  a  very  frail  lady  with  significant 
COPD, emphysema, multiple lung cancers and at this time, she definitely has recurrent 
cancer. I would recommend just radiation therapy alone.  I would not be thrilled to give 
her chemotherapy and radiation together and possibly we could do immunotherapy after 
the radiation, but certainly I think she needs to get that taken care of first before we jump 
into  anything  else.   I  have  asked  her  to  make  sure  she  follows  up  and  makes  an 
appointment.   All  this  was  discussed  at  length  with  the  patient.   She  expressed 
understanding and she is agreeable to see Dr. Chitti after Thanksgiving and I will see 
her in another month and we will take it from there.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gary Meyers is a pleasant 68-year-old gentleman 
from Pittsburgh region with a recent progression of brain metastases from non-small cell 
lung  cancer.   He  presented  originally  at  UPMC  Passavant  in  August  2019  with  left 
hemianopsia  for  1  month  pain  behind  his  left  eye.   MRI  scan  showed  28  x  34  mm 
enhancing right occipital mass and at least 1 other small metastasis, which I believe was 
seen in the left frontal lobe.  CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed left upper 
lobe mass with left hilar periaortic lymphadenopathy and a right adrenal metastasis as 
well  as  T5  metastasis.   He  then  on  September  20,  2019,  underwent  craniotomy  and 
tumor resection.  Pathology was reported as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, TTF-
1  positive,  PD-L1  TPS-40%,  and  on  August  14,  2019,  underwent  Gamma  Knife 
radiosurgery  to  his  operative  bed  and  5  other  metastases.   The  operative  bed  was 
treated  with  a  15  Gy  volume  measuring  38.933  cm  3,  and  5  other  metastases  were 
treated with 18 Gy each for a total of 18 Gy volume measuring 2.059 cm 3.  After that he 
underwent systemic therapy with pembro.  He also had palliative radiotherapy to T5. He 
was  admitted  in  the  past  on  January  20,  2022,  for  hematochezia,  had  a  small  bowel 
tumor with aneurysmal dilatation, invasion into the sigmoid colon and underwent en bloc 
resection  tumor,  and  then  at  that  time  and  then  later  had  a  takedown  of  his  end-
colostomy and partial colectomy with anastomosis, October 30, 2022, with no evidence 
of carcinoma.  His recent MRI scan showed several new small brain metastases and 2 
adjacent  metastases  in  his  left  cerebellum  immediately  adjacent  to  previously  treated 
metastasis and also showed small metastases, right anterior temporal and left anterior 
frontal lobes.  He denies any headaches, seizure activity, or other problems.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Reviewed in EMR.  History of back pain, arthritis, lumbar 
fusion and laminectomy L4-S1, elevated lipids, aortic valve stenosis, aortic aneurysm.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atorvastatin, Keppra, 
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of smoking one-half to 1 pack of cigarettes per day..
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  reviewed in EMR..
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Pleasant, well-nourished gentleman, appearing stated age, well groomed, 
neatly dressed.
HEENT:  PERRL.  EOMI.  Normal cavity and oropharynx.
LUNGS:  Breathing is clear and nonlabored.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular heart rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  Without clubbing or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.
 
DIAGNOSIS:   Progression  of  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  with  brain  metastases  were 
controlled in 2019 by resection of the dominant metastasis, postoperative radiosurgery 
to  the  tumor  bed,  and  5  other  smaller  mets.   He  has  now  had  a  first  recurrence  of 
disease in the brain with 4 small brain metastases that are asymptomatic.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:   Out  of  the  various  management  options,  observation,  whole 
brain radiation therapy, radiosurgery, systemic therapy, I believe radiosurgery would be 
his  best  option.   Recommend  radiosurgery  to  a  dose  of  18  Gy  each  to  his  new  brain 
metastases.  I discussed this with Dr. Niranjan, who agrees.

                          Telemedicine Telephone Visit 

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Michal Krauze, M.D.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C13.8.
 
STAGE:   Synchronous  recurrent  stage  IVb  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  IVA 
squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a synchronous 
diagnosis  of  recurrent  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  and  stage  IVA  locally 
advanced  hypopharynx  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  had  a  prior  history  of  dual  primary 
stage III non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 2018 when he had stage pT3 N1 M0 
invasive  adenocarcinoma  of  the  right  upper  lobe  and  a  second  primary  large  cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma pT1b N0 M0.  He underwent right upper lobe lobectomy with 
an en bloc resection of chest wall ribs 2 and 3, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. At 
that time, he was subsequently followed and no evidence of disease until February of 
2022 when he was noted to have an enlarging right tracheoesophageal groove mass at 
the  thoracic  inlet  with  resulting  horseness.  Additional  workup  including  PET/CT  scan 
performed February 10, 2022, noted an FDG avid lesion involving the right lateral aspect 
of  the  hypopharynx,  the  level  of  the  hyoid,  enlarged  right  level  2  and  3  lymph  node 
lesions as well as FDG avid tracheoesophageal groove adenopathy.  Right upper lobe 
lung nodule and an FDG avid segment 4B   hepatic lesion measuring 3.2 cm concerning 
for metastatic disease.  Additional workup including a EBUS and biopsy of the level 2R 
mediastinal node was negative for malignant cells with scant cellularity.  He was referred 
to  ENT  and  underwent  a  posterior  pharyngeal  wall  biopsy  of  right  posterior  pharynx 
showing  at  least  superficially  invasive  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  a  selective  neck 
dissection  of  right  level  6  contents  showed  metastatic  carcinoma  and  3  of  6  sampled 
lymph nodes with extranodal extension. Lesion in the liver was felt to be too deep for 
biopsy.   MRI  brain  was  performed  on  January  27,  2022  and  negative  for  brain 
metastasis,  initiated  on  additional  systemic  therapy  with  pembrolizumab  and 
pemetrexed,  completed  total  of  12  cycles  of  pembrolizumab  and  pralatrexate  and 
underwent  repeat  imaging  via  PET/CT  on  August  26,  2022  which  showed  persistent 
disease within the right piriform sinus and right neck with favorable response within the 
chest.  Repeat CT chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis on November 28, 2022, showed a 
complete  response  of  his  head  and  neck  lesions  within  the  chest  with  a  stable  7  mm 
right lower lobe lung nodule and response of the previously documented on biopsy liver 
lesion; however, there was persistent unchanged primary tumor within the right piriform 
sinus  and  unchanged  metastatic  right  level  2,  3  cervical  adenopathy.   His  presenting 
symptom was hoarseness, but he tells me his voice quality is subjectively improved.  He 
has difficulty swallowing pills, but tells me is able to eat a normal diet.  He has no taste 
changes or xerostomia.  He presents in Radiation Oncology for discussion of palliative 
radiation  treatment  options  related  to  his  head  and  neck  prior  given  the  favorable 
response noted of his recurrent lung cancer.
 
PRIOR RADIATION THERAPY:  None.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of cerebrovascular accident, on Coumadin. Chronic 
CKD, peripheral artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, history of seizure disorder, 
COPD, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, microcytic anemia, coronary artery disease.
 
PRIOR  SURGICAL  HISTORY:   Transmetatarsal  foot  amputation,  embolectomy, 
thrombolectomy,  left  TMA,  right  VATS  with  lobectomy  and  chest  wall  resection  as  per 
HPI.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Half pack per day smoker x40 years.  Occasional marijuana use.
 
MEDICATIONS:   Cyanocobalamin,  folic  acid,  ondansetron,  amlodipine,  atorvastatin, 
ferrous sulfate, iron, Keppra, metoprolol, Protonix.
 
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI.
HEENT:  As per HPI.
RESPIRATORY: He has never worn oxygen.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented with normal speech and mentation.
 
IMAGING:   PET/CT  scan  obtained  on  February  of  2022,  August  2022,  and  recent  CT 
imaging  with  contrast  enhancement  from  November  of  2022  were  all  personally 
reviewed with findings as per the HPI.
 
LABS:  His last laboratory evaluation was performed on December 1, 2022, showed a 
white count of 9.8, hemoglobin 11.9, platelets 213.  Creatinine 1.23.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent 
metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (initial  stage  dual  primary  pT3  N1  M0 
adenocarcinoma,  and  pT1  N0  M0  large  cell  neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  status  post 
surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy in 2018, now presenting with recurrent metastatic lung 
cancer  and  second  primary  stage  IVA  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  hypopharynx, 
status post palliative systemic therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab.
 
PLAN:  Treatment options were reviewed, and case and findings were discussed with 
Dr.  Krauze.   Given  his  favorable  response  of  his  metastatic  lung  cancer  to 
pembrolizumab  and  pemetrexed;  however,  with  persistence  of  his  head  and  neck 
cancer,  would  favor  consideration  of  palliative  radiotherapy  to  the  head  and  neck  to 
promote  local  control  and  maximize  his  disease-free  survival.   Acute  as  well  as  late 
potential  radiation  related  side  effects  were  reviewed.  I  reviewed  the  rationale  for 
favoring short course radiotherapy over 5 fractions to improve his tolerance to treatment.  
All  the  patient's  questions  were  answered  to  his  satisfaction.   He  made  an  informed 
decision  towards  proceeding  with  radiotherapy,  we  will  schedule  him  for  CT  based 
simulation and plan to proceed next 1-2 weeks thereafter accordingly.  Radiotherapy to 
be  completed  using  IMRT/IGRT  technique  to  spare  surrounding  critical  organs  at  risk 
including  spinal  cord,  parotid,  oral  cavity,  uninvolved  pharyngeal  constrictors, 
esophagus, cord.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.  I 
spent approximately 25-30 minutes in this telephone telemedicine visit, inclusive of time 
reviewing his imaging, extensive medical records relating to his complex cancer, history 
of multiple primary lesions and discussing treatment options with him personally.

This consultation was provided via telephone between the patient and the provider. 
Verbal consent has been received.

                             Clinical Follow-Up Note 

Ms. Pearson is a 79 year old female who presents to the clinic today for her first followup 
visit after completing treatment. To summarize her history, she was initially seen in our 
office in 2019 after being diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the right lung. She received 
radiation therapy to the right middle lobe lung tumor. She was treated with 60 Gy in 15 
fractions. Her treatment concluded on December 4, 2019. On followup imaging, she was 
noted to have a new left upper lobe lung mass. A PET/CT scan revealed FDG activity 
associated with the left upper lobe mass. A biopsy was not recommended due to the risk 
associated  with  the  procedure.  Radiation  therapy  was  recommended  to  the  left  upper 
lobe lung tumor. The left lung tumor received 60 Gy in 30 fractions, and her treatment 
concluded on September 20, 2020. She will continue to be followed closely, and in July 
2022  was  noted  to  have  a  right  lower  lobe  perihilar  nodule  that  increased  in  size 
compared to a CT scan from April 2022. The patient opted to pursue radiation therapy to 
this area as well. She received 36 Gy in 12 fractions to the mass in the right lower lobe 
of the lung. Her treatment concluded on August 31, 2022. She returns to the clinic today 
for her first followup visit after completing treatment.
 
Mrs. Pearson had a CT scan of the chest on November 21, 2022 to follow up from her 
recent  radiation.  While  in  the  Radiology  Department,  she  suffered  a  fall,  and  was 
subsequently seen in the emergency department. A CT scan of the head was negative. 
The results from her CT scan of the chest were reviewed with her at that time, and were 
noted  to  reveal  progressive  disease.  These  results  were  discussed  with  her  via 
telephone  by  Dr.  Jack  Schocker  on  Wednesday  November  23,  2022.  The  previously 
treated nodule within the left upper lobe has increased in size compared to the CT scan 
from July 2022. This nodule now measures 22 x 15 mm. The previously treated area in 
the  right  middle  lobe  remains  unchanged,  and  has  surrounding  stable  post-radiation 
changes. The recently treated area in the right lower lobe continues to enlarge, and is 
now eroding into the right 10th rib. Again, these findings were previously discussed with 
the patient.
 
Mrs. Pearson is tearful during today's visit. We discussed the fact that further radiation 
therapy  is  not  indicated  at  this  time,  per  Dr.  Jack  Schocker.  She  has  been  treated 
several  times,  and  her  disease  continues  to  progress.  Systemic  therapy  would  be  an 
appropriate option at this time, although choices will likely be limited due to her multiple 
sclerosis. I spoke with Dr. Mohammad Alkayem during our visit today, and he agrees to 
see her in the near future. She is concerned about her ongoing pain in the area of the 
destructive lesion of the posterior right 10th rib. A referral was placed to palliative care to 
discuss pain management. She reports ongoing shortness of breath, although she states 
this has not increased significantly. Her main concern is quantity of life, and living to see 
her  granddaughter  get  married  in  approximately  one  year.  Again,  she  is  tearful  during 
today's visit, and is difficult to engage in conversation.
 
On  exam,  she  is  alert,  oriented,  and  in  no  acute  distress.  Her  neck  is  supple  with  no 
masses  or  adenopathy.  Her  heart  has  a  regular  rate  and  rhythm,  and  her  lungs  have 
decreased breath sounds throughout. She has pain to palpation over the right posterior 
chest wall.
 
The patient will return to our office in two months for repeat evaluation. She will be seen 
by Dr. Mohammad Alkayem in the near future to discuss options for systemic therapy. A 
referral  was  placed  for  her  to  be  seen  by  palliative  care  to  discuss  pain  management 
options. Her questions were addressed to the best of my ability during today's visit. She 
will  contact  our  office  with  further  questions,  concerns,  or  need  to  be  seen.  This  was 
discussed  and  agreed  upon  with  Dr.  Jack  Schocker,  who  was  available  throughout 
today's visit.

                                   Office Note 

DIAGNOSES: 
1.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung, status post radiation, December 10, 2020.
2.  Evidence of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lung via biopsy, December 7, 
2021.  PD-L1 of 30%.
 
PREVIOUS THERAPY: Keytruda x12 doses.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Carboplatin and Taxol.  The patient is due for cycle 1 today.
 
INTERVAL  HISTORY:   Ms.  Smith  is  here  for  history  of  unresectable  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the lung, progressive. CT scan, September 15, 2022, showed new right-
sided rib metastasis.  There was an expansile lytic met in the anterior 6th rib.  The mass 
invaded  the  left  hilar  and  mediastinum  encasing  multiple  hilar  structures,  which 
demonstrated  reocclusion  of  the  left  superior  pulmonary  vein,  though  no  change  in 
background pulmonary fibrosis.  The patient has been declining chemotherapy and was 
on Keytruda at that time.  At her last visit, the patient discussed starting chemotherapy 
with  Taxol  and  carboplatin.   She  is  here  today  to  start  that  chemotherapy.   The 
chemotherapy  has  been  on  hold  because  of  COVID  at  the  beginning  of  October.   On 
October 24, the patient continued to have discolored sputum from her cough and was 
still  not  feeling  well.   The  patient  then  was  admitted  to  St.  Margaret's  Hospital, 
September 16th due to left shoulder pain and was found to have a pathologic fracture of 
the left clavicle with large soft tissue mass involving the bone.  She then went on to have 
a  detailed  course  of  2D  technique  radiotherapy  for  palliative  treatment  of  her  bone 
metastasis.   The  patient  was  discharged  on  November  18th  to  skilled  nursing  facility.  
The patient states she signed herself out and is now living at home.  On November 30th, 
the  patient  went  to  the  Emergency  Room  at  St.  Margaret's  complaining  of  worsening 
neuropathy,  poor  appetite,  poor  fluid  intake.   The  patient  was  given  IV  fluids  and  was 
found  to  have  a  chronic  sacral  decubitus  with  no  infections.   The  patient  had  no 
evidence  of  UTI.   No  infection  around  the  PowerPort.    She  was  given  IV  fluids  for 
rehydration  and  was  discharged.   Today,  the  patient  states  she  wants  to  start  her 
chemotherapy.  She still has pain in that left shoulder and is taking OxyContin.  She has 
the wound at the base of her spine that is being cared for by the visiting nurses.  She 
states  her  appetite  is  very  poor.   She  does  drink  Carnation  Instant  Breakfast  and  can 
only take small amounts at a time.  She has lost weight.  She has neuropathy from the

COVID  and  recovered  from  COVID,  so  treatment  was  delayed.   She  then  was 
hospitalized and discharged from St. Margaret's Hospital on November 18th.  She was 
found to have a left shoulder pathologic fracture of the left clavicle with large soft tissue 
mass  involving  the  bone.   She  completed  2D  technique  radiotherapy  for  palliative 
treatment of her bone metastasis.  The patient was then discharged to skilled nursing 
facility.  She went to the ER on November 30th and was noted to be dehydrated.  She 
was  rehydrated  and  released.  The  patient  signed  herself  out  of  skilled  nursing  facility 
and is now living at home.  She is here today and request to have her chemotherapy 
treatment  today.   The  patient  is  aware  that  treatment  can  cause  life-altering  or  life-
threatening side effects.  The patient to call our office for any side effects.  Encouraged 
her  to  increase  her  fluid  intake  and  eat  small  meals.   We  will  continue  to  monitor  the 
patient closely for toxicities of treatment.  All the patient's questions were answered to 
her satisfaction.  She is to follow up in our office in 3 weeks or sooner if indicated.

DATE OF VISIT:    12/19/2022

                                   Office Note 

DIAGNOSIS:   Squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  right  lung  diagnosed  in  November  of 
2021.
 
PREVIOUS TREATMENT:  
1.  The patient had a screening chest CT due to his smoking history in November of 202. 
He  was  found  to  have  a  4.9  x  6.6  cm  right  infrahilar  mass  with  probable  right  hilar 
adenopathy.   PET  imaging  in  December  revealed  uptake  in  the  right  lower  lobe 
extending into the right hilum without hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.  Brain MRI was 
negative.
2.  In January of 2022, he underwent right lower lobectomy with wedge resection of the 
right middle lobe and lymph node sampling.  Pathology revealed keratinizing squamous 
cell carcinoma.  Tumor measured 6.8 cm. Angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion 
were seen.  One of 11 N1 nodes were positive.  The middle lobe wedge resection also 
revealed a 1.8 cm squamous cell carcinoma with 1 of 3 nodes positive.  There were two 
squamous cell carcinomas, one in the right lower lobe and one in the right middle lobe, 
but  based  on  the  morphologic  findings,  these  were  felt  to  represent  the  same  tumor.  
PD-L1 was 60%.  Margins were negative.  He was staged at T4 N1a M0 disease with 
complete resection.  He was subsequently treated with adjuvant Taxotere and cisplatin 
through May of 2022.  The patient was then planning to relocate to New Jersey.  He did 
have a post-treatment PET in June, which showed some improvement, but there was a 
concern  about  residual  recurrent  disease  and  a  possible  new  focus  in  the  right  upper 
lobe.   Again,  he  was  planning  to  move  to  New  Jersey  at  that  time  and  was 
recommended to reestablish care when he settled down.
3.   He  apparently  never  relocated  and  then  followed  up  in  October  with  Thoracic 
Surgery. Followup PET imaging at that time unfortunately revealed a mass in the right 
lung  significantly  increased  in  size.   He  underwent  biopsy  on  October  24th,  which 
showed  metastatic  squamous  cell  carcinoma.   PD-L1  TPS  was  3%.   He  was  referred 
back  to  Medical  Oncology  and  Radiation  Oncology  and  recommendations  were  for 
concurrent chemoradiation with paclitaxel and carboplatin.  Recent CT imaging showed 
no other metastatic disease.
 
CURRENT TREATMENT:  Plan is to begin weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin today.
 
INTERIM  HISTORY:   George  Smith  is  seen  today  for  his  diagnosis  of  squamous  cell 
carcinoma  of  the  right  lung  with  recent  recurrence.   He  has  been  seen  by  Radiation 
Oncology  and  will  start  radiation  today  as  well.   He  reports  feeling  well.   He  denies 
fevers,  chills  or  other  infection  symptoms.   No  new  chest  pain,  shortness  of  breath, 
cough  or  other  exertional  symptoms.  Since  his  last  surgery,  he  was  placed  on 
gabapentin.   He  is  taking  100  mg  b.i.d.  for  neuropathic  symptoms  involving  the  right 
ribcage as well as his hands and feet.  He has not seen a significant change, but has not 
been on it for an extended period of time.  Appetite and weight are stable.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Amlodipine, low-dose aspirin, gabapentin, and tamsulosin.
 
ALLERGIES:  NARCOTICS.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married, living with his spouse.  He is a former smoker, but 
denies current tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drug use.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged from previous exam.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Per the interim history.  All other review of systems negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:   This  is  a  comfortable-appearing  57-year-old  African  American  male.  
Performance status, ECOG 0.
VITAL  SIGNS:   Blood  pressure  131/77,  pulse  53,  respirations  16,  temperature  96.6, 
weight is 239.9 pounds.
SKIN:  Without icterus or pallor.  No rashes or ecchymoses appreciated.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  No icterus or pallor.  Oral mucosa pink 
and moist, no lesions or exudate.
NECK:   Supple,  without  palpable  lymphadenopathy  in  the  cervical  or  supraclavicular 
spaces.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur or gallop.
LUNGS:  Clear of rales or wheezes.  Good respiratory effort.  No chest wall tenderness 
with palpation.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, audible bowel sounds throughout.  No palpable masses or 
organomegaly appreciated.  No CVA tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  No calf tenderness or palpable 
cords.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3 and appropriate.  Grossly nonfocal.
 
LABORATORY  DATA:   From  December  16th,  CBC  shows  a  hemoglobin  of  11.5, 
hematocrit  of  34.4,  platelets  are  337,000,  WBC  6.0.   Differential  was  unremarkable.  
CMP  shows  normal  electrolytes,  creatinine  is  1.68,  calcium  is  9.0.   Liver  enzymes 
unremarkable.  Magnesium was 2.1.
 
ASSESSMENT:  Recurrent squamous cell carcinoma involving the right lung with plans 
to begin concurrent chemoradiation with weekly Taxol and carboplatin today.
 
PLAN:  I reviewed the results of his laboratory studies with George and his wife.  He will 
start  treatment  today  and  continue  Taxol  and  carboplatin  weekly  with  radiation.  We 
discussed  possible  side  effects  regarding  his  current  chemotherapy  regimen  including 
fatigue,  myelosuppression,  nausea  and  emesis,  increased  risk  of  infection  and 
peripheral  neuropathy.   He  was  encouraged  to  monitor  for  worsening  neuropathic 
symptoms and we certainly can increase the dose of his gabapentin as needed.  We will 
see him back for followup in 2 weeks for reassessment.   He has Compazine at home to 
use as needed for any treatment-associated nausea and emesis.

DIAGNOSIS:  Brain metastasis.
 
CODE:  C79.31.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Phelps returned for followup of his non-small 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain  metastases.   He  was  treated  with  stereotactic 
radiosurgery to the left frontal metastasis in August 2021.  He has been doing fairly well.  
He has had headaches for the past couple of days.  He had an MRI of the brain done 
today,which showed an increase in the old treated left frontal lesion to 1.8 cm with some 
increase in surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal changes.  There were no new lesions.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has noted some headaches for the past couple of days.  
Denied any vision change, focal weakness, difficulty walking.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  He was in NAD.
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 80, respirations 16, blood pressure 125/70, weight 149 pounds.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves were intact.  Motor function was 5/5.  Gait was intact.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  X-rays were reviewed.  MRI of the brain done today showed a 
1.8 cm left frontal lesion, which had increased compared to the MRI from August 4, 2022 
with some increase in surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal changes.  There were no new 
lesions.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  MRI of the brain done today showed some increase in the 
old treated left frontal lesion.  The MRI from February 2022 and August 2022 with some 
increase in surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal changes suspicious for recurrent disease.  
There were no new lesions.  Plan will be for a short followup MRI in 4-6 weeks.  If the left 
frontal lesion were to increase, then the plan would be to retreat with radiosurgery.
 
Total time spent on today's visit was 25 minutes. This included preparation for today's 
visit,  history  and  physical  exam,  review  of  the  diagnostic  tests,  and  time  spent 
documenting today's service.

PATIENT ID#:      075433232
DATE OF BIRTH:    09/12/1968
DATE OF VISIT:    12/27/2022

                                   Office Note 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Mondine is a patient with a history of metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the lung.  He originally came to me from the VA System and he was 
in hospice after developing some problems being on high-dose steroids because of his 
brain  metastases.   Eventually,  he  did  finally  recover  to  the  point  where  the  brain 
metastases  were  treated  with  SRS  and  he  went  on  pembrolizumab  single  agent 
because he had a high PD-L1. Unfortunately, after a few doses, he got much worse, was 
hospitalized,  he  had  to  have  his  mediastinum  radiated  because  of  shift  of  the 
mediastinum  from  expansion  of  the  tumor.   He  did  well  with  that  and  eventually  we 
added the chemotherapy to the pembrolizumab.  He did well with that for a while, but 
eventually  progressed.   He  was  on  HCC  21-122  and  received  atezolizumab  and 
cobimetinib and he had one cycle and then came into the hospital with pneumonitis. It 
primarily was in his left lung and it was a little unclear as to whether this was treatment 
related or it was an infection.  He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-
dose  steroids  and  recovered  to  the  point  where  now  he  is  just  on  oxygen  4L  with 
exertion and at night.  I did discuss what happened to him with the PI on the trial Dr. Liu 
and it was felt that since it could potentially be treatment related and may be from the 
combination of the drugs and since he had some slight progression on teatment that he 
would have to come off the trial.   We discussed potential for another trial, but most of 
them  include  immunotherapy  and  he  would  be  excluded  because  of  this  episode  of 
pneumonitis  whether  it  was  treatment  related  or  not.  So,  we  decided  to  put  him  on 
docetaxel, which he has not received and because he has a performance status around 
the 2 range, I elected to go with weekly docetaxel.  He is going to get 30 mg/m2 weekly 
for  either  2  out  of  3  or  3  out  of  4  weeks  depending  on  how  he  does.   He  will  not  get 
ramucirumab because he did have some hemoptysis in the past.  He is actually doing 
pretty well.  He gained some weight.  He is at his brother's house, so he is not smoking.  
His respiratory status has been pretty stable.  He has some chronic pain issues and he 
gets his pain medicines from the VA and he has not been taking as much oxycodone as 
he was in the past.  He has not had any new problems.  He has no peripheral edema.  
No new neurologic issues.  He did have an MRI of his brain not all that long ago, which 
showed stability of the post-treatment changes.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The rest of his 10-point review of systems is unremarkable.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  He looks well.
VITAL SIGNS:  His weight is up about 6 pounds.  He is afebrile.  His pulse is 64 and his 
blood pressure is 98/67, which is what he was running last time, his pulse ox is 96% on 
2 liters.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
NECK:  He has no adenopathy.
LUNGS:   On  examining  his  lungs,  he  has  bronchial  breathing,  particularly  in  the  right 
upper lobe and generally decreased breath sounds on that right side. Left lung is clear.
CARDIAC EXAM:  Reveals a regular rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no peripheral edema.
 
LABORATORY  DATA:   Shows  white  count  6.1,  hemoglobin  was  11.1,  platelets  are 
300,000.   He  has  adequate  neutrophils.   His  electrolytes  are  fine.   His  creatinine  has 
improved to 1.1.  Transaminases and bilirubin are also normal.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  So, my impression is that overall he is doing reasonably 
well at this point and I think he could tolerate the weekly docetaxel.  I am reluctant to add 
any ramucirumab because he has had a history of hemoptysis periodically in the past 
and  actually  had  it  with  that  episode  of  pneumonitis  for  which  he  ended  up  in  the 
hospital.  We went over all the potential side effects of treatment and I told him either we 
would do 2 out of 3 weeks or 3 out of 4 weeks depending on how he does.  Our plan is 
to go ahead with week #1 of docetaxel.  He has antiemetics at home and I will plan to 
see how he does next week with his second dose of treatment.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Shannon Puhalla.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Brain metastases.
 
CODE:  C79.31.
 
This was a telemedicine visit.
 
Mr.  Bilenski  has  a  history  of  a  non-small  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  brain 
metastases.   He  was  treated  with  stereotactic  radiosurgery  to  left  superior  frontal  and 
right  superior  frontal  metastases  in  September  2018,  right  occipital  and  left  frontal, 
January  2019;  right  cerebellar,  May  2019;  right  posterior  temporal  and  left  posterior 
temporal  in  August  2019.   He  has  been  doing  well.   He  had  an  MRI  of  the  brain  on 
January 3, 2023, which showed no evidence of recurrent disease.  The old treated left 
superior  frontal  lesion  was  stable  with  a  small  amount  of  surrounding  T2  and  FLAIR 
signal change that was stable.  The other old lesions were really no longer seen.  There 
were no new lesions.
 
MRI on January 3, 2023, showed no evidence of recurrent disease.  The old treated left 
superior frontal lesion was stable.  There were no new lesions.  We will follow up with an 
MRI in 6 months.
 
Total time spent on today's visit was 15 minutes.  This included preparation for today's 
visit, review of the diagnostic tests and time spent documenting today's service.
 
This  consultation  was  provided  via  telemedicine  from  patients  home  using  two-way, 
real-time  interactive  telecommunications  technology  between  the  patient  and  provider.

                                   Office Note 

REASON FOR VISIT:  Followup of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In November 2021 due to his smoking history, the 
patient underwent a CT scan.  This revealed a 4.9 x 6.6 cm right infrahilar mass with 
right hilar adenopathy.  PET scan in December confirmed uptake in the right lower lobe 
extending into the right hilum without hilar and mediastinal adenopathy.  Brain MRI was 
negative.   He  subsequently  underwent  resection  in  January  2022  with  a  right  lower 
lobectomy  and  wedge  resection  of  the  right  middle  lobe  and  lymph  node  sampling.  
Pathology revealed keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.  The tumor measured 6.8 cm.  
Angiolymphatic and visceral pleural invasion was seen.  One out of 11 N1 nodes were 
positive.  Middle lobe wedge resection also revealed a 1.8 cm squamous cell carcinoma 
with 1/3 positive nodes.  There were 2 squamous cell carcinomas, one in the right lower 
lobe and one in the right middle lobe, but based on the morphologic findings, these were 
felt to represent the same tumor.  PD-L1 was 60%.  Margins were negative.  He was 
staged  as  T4  N1a  M0  disease  with  a  complete  resection.   He  was  then  treated  with 
adjuvant  docetaxel/cisplatin  through  May  2022.   He  was  then  planning  to  relocate  to 
New Jersey.  PET scan in June revealed improvement, but there was a concern about a 
new focus in the right upper lobe.  It was recommended that he follow up with Oncology 
in New Jersey, but he apparently never relocated.  He then followed up with his surgeon 
in  Pittsburgh,  a  PET  scan  revealed  a  confirmed  mass  in  the  right  lung,  which  had 
increased in size.  Biopsy in October confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.  PD-L1 TPS 
was 3%.  He was referred back for possible systemic therapy.  A CT scan in December 
confirmed  a  3.3  x  4.5  cm  right  paramediastinal  soft  tissue  mass  superior  to  the  right 
main pulmonary artery, but no evidence of metastatic disease.  The feeling was that he 
could  be  treated  as  recurrent  disease  with  chemoradiotherapy.   He  started 
paclitaxel/carboplatin/radiation in December 2022.
 
REVIEW  OF  SYSTEMS:   Mr.  Smith  comes  in  today  for  followup  and  to  continue  his 
treatment.  This is 3rd weekly dose of therapy.  He is tolerating this fairly well.  He denies 
fevers  or  chills.   He  has  some  minimal  nausea  and  some  occasional  diarrhea,  but 
nothing severe.  He denies blood in the bowels.  He denies any angina-type chest pain.  
He  still  does  have  some  postsurgical  pain  along  the  right  chest  wall.   He  denies 
shortness of breath or cough.  He denies focal neurologic deficits or any other bone or 
joint pain.  He denies adenopathy.  Appetite is fair.  All other systems were reviewed with 
the patient and are negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished African American male in no acute distress.
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  96.3,  heart  rate  112,  respiratory  rate  15,  blood  pressure 
147/90, weight 230.4 pounds, which is down 9.5 pounds.
HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  No 
scleral  icterus.   Oropharynx  is  moist  and  pink  without  tonsillar  erythema  or  exudate.  
There is no thrush and there are no mouth ulcers.
NECK:  No JVD or thyromegaly.
NODES:  No anterior cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary adenopathy palpable.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Occasional wheezes.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds,  no 
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No cords or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.
SKIN:  No rash or petechiae.
 
LABORATORY DATA AND IMAGING:  Blood work December 30th shows a white count 
6.6,  hemoglobin  10.9,  hematocrit  32.5,  platelets  364,000.   Chemistry  panel  reveals  a 
stable creatinine of 1.47 with a GFR of 55.  LFTs are normal.
 
ASSESSMENT:  A 57-year-old African American male with a history of squamous cell 
carcinoma,  status  post  resection  and  adjuvant  chemotherapy.   He  was  then  found  to 
have a recurrence in the right lung.  He is receiving combined chemoradiotherapy and 
tolerating this well.
 
PLAN:   Mr.  Smith  has  a  potentially  life-threatening  malignancy  and  is  receiving 
antineoplastic therapy requiring intensive monitoring due to risks for morbidity/mortality.  
During his visit today, I conducted a patient interview with a thorough review of systems 
and physical exam to monitor for side effects, such as fatigue, neuropathy, etc., that can 
contribute to morbidity/mortality.  He is acceptable to continue his current antineoplastic 
therapy.  I went over the blood work with him today.  Things look good.  I told him as far 
as the pain he is having in the right ribcage, first, we could try something like Tylenol.  
We will see him back in 2 weeks.  We will keep checking his blood work weekly.  After 
the conclusion of therapy, we will reimage him and then likely moving on to durvalumab.  
If there are any problems prior to that visit, he can call the office.

PATIENT ID#:      075622312
DATE OF BIRTH:    01/20/1937
DATE OF VISIT:    01/12/2023

                                   Office Note 

PRINCIPAL  DIAGNOSIS:   Metastatic  adenocarcinoma  of  the  lung  with  left  adrenal 
metastases,  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy,  PD-L1  positive  at  2%,  no  actionable 
mutations identified.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.  This has been on hold for the 
past 6 weeks.
 
PRIOR THERAPY:
1.   The  patient  underwent  left  lower  lobectomy  in  July  2018  revealing  poorly 
differentiated  adenocarcinoma  involving  the  visceral  pleural  surface,  focal 
lymphovascular invasion.  One out of one lymph nodes involved.  Pathologic stage T2 
N1, stage IIB.
2.  The patient received 4 cycles of carboplatin and Alimta in the adjuvant setting.
3.  The patient was found to have a new right upper lobe nodule concerning for residual 
disease.   She  underwent  right  upper  lobe  anterior  segmentectomy  in  February  2019, 
which showed invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins, T1b N0.
4.  The patient was found to have left adrenal nodule with FDG uptake in July 2019.  She 
underwent  left  adrenalectomy  in  August  2019,  which  showed  a  2.5  cm  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma with negative margins.
5.  The patient was found to have FDG-avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy and several 
bilateral pulmonary nodules and she was started on systemic therapy.
6.  The patient was started on carboplatin, Taxol, and pembrolizumab for 4 cycles and 
has been on pembrolizumab maintenance.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Breo Ellipta, budesonide, buspirone, multivitamin, Colace, 
Pepcid,  iron  sulfate  daily,  folic  acid,  Lasix  p.r.n.,  gabapentin,  Incruse  Ellipta,  and 
metformin.  The patient was previously on methotrexate weekly, but this was stopped 2 
weeks  ago.   Metoprolol,  Protonix,  probiotic,  Carafate,  Tylenol  p.r.n.,  albuterol  p.r.n., 
vitamin  B  complex,  vitamin  D,  Lovenox  injections  twice  daily,  prednisone  10  mg  daily, 
and Imodium p.r.n.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  She 
was last seen on November 29, 2022.  Since that time, her pembrolizumab has been on 
hold.   Due  to  concern  for  possible  pneumonitis,  she  has  been  on  prednisone  10  mg 
daily; however, her dyspnea with exertion has not improved and has actually worsened 
over the past few weeks.  She is wearing 5 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula at night and 
she wakes up at night with shortness of breath.  Her appetite is moderate.  Her energy 
level  is  low.   She  has  occasional  headache.   She  has  chronic  cough.   She  has  had 
diarrhea for the past week and she has been taking Imodium as needed.  She has some 
abdominal cramping associated with bowel movements over the past week as well.  She 
has had no bleeding.  She has had no recent infections.  She has no fevers, chills, chest 
pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or urinary symptoms.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  96.7,  heart  rate  77,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
105/66, weight 198 pounds.  Performance status is 3.
GENERAL:  No acute distress, comfortable, elderly female in a wheelchair.
HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:   The  patient  has  decreased  breath  sounds  at  the  right  lung  base.   No 
wheezing is appreciated.
CHEST:  Left-sided MediPort in place.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, mild tenderness to palpation diffusely, nondistended.  Positive bowel 
sounds, no palpable hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Edema of lower extremities bilaterally.  No cyanosis, clubbing, or calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rashes or lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy is appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  The patient is generally weak.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  From December 28th, white blood cell count 8.9, hemoglobin 
11.1, hematocrit 33.9, platelets 247.  From November 29th, complete metabolic profile 
significant for creatinine of 1.07.  TSH 1.48, free T4 of 1.4.
 
ASSESSMENT  AND  PLAN:   85-year-old  female  with  a  history  of  deep  venous 
thrombosis,  status  post  IVC  filter,  now  on  Lovenox  due  to  recent  left  lower  extremity 
deep  venous  thrombosis  and  Xarelto  failure,  atrial  fibrillation,  gastroesophageal  reflux 
disease,  prior  stroke,  cerebral  hemorrhage,  history  of  anxiety,  mild  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease,  history  of  localized  breast  cancer  10  years  ago,  who  presents  for 
followup for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, initially stage IIB disease, now with 
recurrence in the right upper lobe after surgery and chemotherapy.  She developed left 
adrenal  metastases,  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy.   Tumor  is  PD-L1  positive,  KRAS 
mutation  positive.   No  actionable  mutations  identified.   She  has  been  receiving 
pembrolizumab  maintenance,  but  this  was  held  over  the  past  6  weeks  due  to 
immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis.  She has been on prednisone 10 mg daily, but her 
breathing has gotten worse.  She had a CT of the chest due prior to this appointment, 
but she was unable to go due to diarrhea.  We will continue to hold the pembrolizumab 
as she is clinically worse.  We will obtain a chest x-ray due to concern for possible right 
pleural effusion based on my exam today and we will plan for repeat CT of the chest as 
soon as possible.  For now, she will continue on prednisone.  We will continue to hold 
the pembrolizumab and she will continue on Lovenox for history of thrombosis.  We will 
tentatively make an appointment for return to clinic in 6 weeks.  Her methotrexate has 
been  recently  held  by  her  rheumatologist  and  she  was  due  to  start  Arava,  but  I 
recommend  holding  this  until  she  is  feeling  better.   For  now,  she  will  continue  on 
Imodium for the diarrhea, but if this worsens or if her breathing worsens, she may need 
to go to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.  She will contact our office for 
any questions or concerns in the interim.

TREATMENT NARRATIVE:  Mr. Scott is a 68-year-old male with a history of recurrent 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He had a prior history of synchnrous primary non-
small  cell  lung  cancer  pT3  N1  M0  adenocarcinoma  and  pT1  N0  M0  large  cell 
neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  status  post  surgery,  adjuvant  chemotherapy  in  2018,  he 
recently  presented  with  recurrent  metastatic  lung  cancer  and  a  second  primary  stage 
IVA  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  hypopharynx,   he  recieved  palliative  systemic 
therapy  with  pemetrexed  and  pembrolizumab  with  clinical  response  of  his  metastatic 
lung cancer and persistence of his head and neck cancer and thus completed a course 
of  palliative  radiotherapy  to  the  head  and  neck  aimed  to  promote  a  local  control  and 
maximize  his  disease-free  interval.   Radiotherapy  as  outlined  above  using  VMAT 
technique with 6X-FFF photons with delivering dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions.  He overall 
tolerated radiotherapy well.  He had some mild hoarseness at the conclusion of therapy 
and  voice  change.   He  otherwise  was  able  to  complete  without  interruption  or 
complication.  He will follow with Medical Oncology for continuation of systemic therapy 
and return in 1 month for Telehealth followup.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.

Dear Dr. Malvar:
 
Mrs. Vasquez presents today for followup of stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung, currently on 
Opdivo.  On March 21, 2019, she had a CAT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which 
showed no evidence of progression.  She has a stable right upper lobe nodule 2 x 1.6 cm and 
no evidence of any other disease.  She does have a right hilar lymph node 2.8 cm in size.  She 
reports some dysesthesia in her fingertips, but is otherwise without complaints.  She is finding it 
more difficult to continue to come to the cancer center in Beaver and wishes to follow up further 
at UPMC in New Castle.
 
She actually initially was seen by Dr. Simon in New Castle in approximately December 2014.  
She initially underwent resection of the left lower lobe nodule approximately in April 2014 for a 
T2aN0M0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, that looks subtypes of papillary, acinar, 
and lepidic, 3.5 x 2.8 x 3.5 cm incised.  Followup in August 2014 with CT scan showed multiple 
pulmonary nodules and further followup in December 2014 showed these are not glucose avid.  
The nodules continued to increase and she was evaluated by Ryan Levy, MD.  and by Dr. Kaul 
on November 2, 2015.  She got a biopsy of her right lower lobe nodule which showed recurrent 
adenocarcinoma of the lung, TTF-1 positive, CK7 positive, CK20 negative.  This had a lepidic 
growth pattern.  EGFR was negative and ALK1 was negative.  This was performed at Heritage 
Valley Beaver.  At that time, although additional driver mutations were not available and they 
have not been performed.  She was treated with carboplatin and Alimta from March 8, 2016, to 
May 17, 2016, followed by Alimta maintenance until August 10, 2016.  In October 2016, she had 
an increase in the pulmonary nodules, so on November 2, 2016, she was started on Opdivo 
with a complete response and continues to do well on this regimen.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All systems reviewed and as per HPI.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 148 pounds, temperature 98.5, pulse 67, respirations 16, blood 
pressure 165/58, O2 saturation 100%, pain 0/10, fatigue 0/10.
GENERAL:  Sitting comfortably in no apparent distress.
EYES:  Conjunctivae and lids are pink, moist, without lesions or ptosis.  Pupils and irides are 
equal and normally reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact, without scleral icterus.
EARS, NOSE, MOUTH AND THROAT:  Nasal mucosa, septum, and turbinates show the 
mucosa to be pink and the airway clear.  Oropharynx has no oral ulcerations or exudate.
NODES:  There are no palpable nodes in the axilla, cervical, supraclavicular, or inguinal area.
SKIN:  No abnormal nevi, ecchymoses, petechiae, rashes or masses on inspection or palpation.
CHEST:  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Auscultation of the heart reveals no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Carotid 
arteries reveal no neck vein distention or bruits.
ABDOMEN:  No hepatosplenomegaly, guarding, tenderness or masses.  Bowel sounds are 
normal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Extremities show no edema, clubbing, cyanosis or joint deformity.  No 
tenderness on percussion of the spine.
 
IMPRESSION:  Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Continue Opdivo consistent with the FDA dosing recommendation.  
She does have some interest in stopping the therapy if possible. She will follow up at the  
UPMC Cancer Center in New Castle.  If there are any additional questions or anything that I can 
do to help with transition and care, do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Sincerely,

do to help with transition and care, do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Sincerely,

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, high PD-L1 expression.

PRIOR THERAPY:
1. PET/CT scan, February 2015 revealing a 13 mm FDG avid left upper lobe nodule as well as 
left hilar adenopathy.
2. CT-guided left lung biopsy, February 18, 2015, revealed non-small cell lung carcinoma, 
histology unclassified.
3. Mediastinoscopy, April 6, 2018, positive left level 4 lymph node.
4. Received 3 cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin and Alimta, completed May 2015.
5. August 19, 2015, underwent left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node resection 
revealing a 1.5 cm invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, probable acinar type with 2/2 
lymph nodes positive in the left level 5 for T1a N1 disease.
6. Completed sequential chemoradiation with carboplatin and Taxol followed by radiation, 
January 4, 2016, through February 23, 2016.
7. Post-treatment CT scan, May 3, 2016, showed no evidence of residual disease.
8. Developed clinical lymphadenopathy in the left neck with ultrasound on July 26, 2016, 
showing multiple round, slightly enlarged lymph nodes, the largest measuring about 1.4 x 1.3 
and 0.9 cm in size respectively.
9. August 28, 2017, underwent biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node revealing 
metastatic carcinoma, non-small cell type. Molecular studies were negative for EGFR and ALK-
1. PD-L1 expression was high at 91%-100%.

CURRENT THERAPY:  Pembrolizumab 200 mg q.21 days, cycle 1, day 1 on October 3, 2017.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today for 
continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma with 
adenocarcinoma histology.  He has currently been on single-agent pembrolizumab for about a 
year and half and has having almost complete remission.  Recently, he has had an upper 
respiratory viral-like infection about 3-week interval and lot of difficulty with how he feels.  
Overall, he has had some increased swelling in his lower extremity.  He has had decreased 
interest in food and appetite.  He has again lost about 5 pounds over the last month and half or 
so.  He is actually up a pound from last visit we saw him, however.  He still has some 
macrocytosis and some elevated LFTs, although improving.  He again declares that he is not 
drinking any alcohol at this time.  In the past, recall he has had significant difficulty with alcohol 
abuse.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No recent fevers or chills, night sweats.  No headaches or visual 
changes.  No lightheadedness or dizziness.  No cough or rhinorrhea.  He does have some sore 
throat and some hoarseness.  He has no chest discomfort.  He has some shortness of breath.  
No abdominal pain.  He has decreased appetite.  No nausea or vomiting.  No diarrhea or 
constipation.  No melena or hematochezia.  No peripheral rashes.  He does have bilateral lower 
extremity swelling.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amlodipine.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Clonidine.
4.  Etodolac.
5.  Gabapentin.
6.  Hydroxyzine.
7.  Metoprolol.
8.  Mirtazapine.
9.  Omeprazole.
10.  Oxycodone.
11.  Spiriva.
12.  Ventolin.
13.  Symbicort.
14.  Stool softeners.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight today 153.5 from 152.4 last visit.  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure 
134/85, pulse 76, respirations 16, pulse ox 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  ECOG performance status of 0.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  Conjunctivae are pink.  Oropharynx is clear without exudate or 
erythema.
NECK:  Supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  Overall some decreased breath sounds in the bases, but fairly clear.
HEART:  Tachy, but regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, no obvious hepatosplenomegaly.
PERIPHERAL:  Shows 1+ edema from about the mid shin down to the dorsum of the foot 
bilaterally.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed from May 24th showed white count of 7.9, hemoglobin 13.7, 
MCV 103.5, platelet count of 307.  Chemistries showed sodium 128, BUN and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  Calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, ALT of 25, AST of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
RADIOLOGY:  CT scan dated May 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  There was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  The 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  I believe he looks 
a little better than last time I saw him.  He still is somewhat suppressed.  He seems overtly 
depressed.  I am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  He says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time I encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  I 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  In general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
He has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which I think are probably accounting for some 
of the CT changes.  I have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  I know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  He may 
be becoming refractory to Keytruda, but I doubt at this point.  I plan to take him until October 
and then stop his Keytruda.  I also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  He does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  Again, I am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  I 
did put him on 20 of Lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  We will see him back for 
treatment on Wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  If he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

134/85, pulse 76, respirations 16, pulse ox 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.  ECOG performance status of 0.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  Conjunctivae are pink.  Oropharynx is clear without exudate or 
erythema.
NECK:  Supple without cervical lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  Overall some decreased breath sounds in the bases, but fairly clear.
HEART:  Tachy, but regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, no obvious hepatosplenomegaly.
PERIPHERAL:  Shows 1+ edema from about the mid shin down to the dorsum of the foot 
bilaterally.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed from May 24th showed white count of 7.9, hemoglobin 13.7, 
MCV 103.5, platelet count of 307.  Chemistries showed sodium 128, BUN and creatinine of 7 
and 0.92.  Calcium was 9.2, albumin 4.1, bilirubin 0.5, ALT of 25, AST of 46, alkaline 
phosphatase of 82.
 
RADIOLOGY:  CT scan dated May 20, 2019, of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was reviewed, 
which showed increased soft tissue density along the upper left posterior mediastinum at the 
level of the aortic arch to the left hilum measuring about 1.9 cm in thickness.  There was some 
new mildly enlarged precarinal space and soft tissue in the right paratracheal space.  The 
previously described nodule in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe was not present.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today 
for continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  I believe he looks 
a little better than last time I saw him.  He still is somewhat suppressed.  He seems overtly 
depressed.  I am concerned that he may be not telling me, but back to his consumption of 
alcohol.  He says he is going to call his psychiatrist again because he is feeling down; however, 
he told me that last time I encouraged him that he really should follow up for some counseling.  I 
am not sure what to make of his scan.  In general, he has had a complete response in the past.  
He has a little bit of upper respiratory symptoms, which I think are probably accounting for some 
of the CT changes.  I have asked him to start on antibiotic, which he refused today.  I know he is 
getting a little bit more hyponatremic suggestive of an underlying pulmonary process.  He may 
be becoming refractory to Keytruda, but I doubt at this point.  I plan to take him until October 
and then stop his Keytruda.  I also think it may be worthwhile stopping his therapy at this point 
simply observing him.  He does seem to have some lower extremity edema.  Again, I am 
concerned that some of this may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction from alcohol.  I 
did put him on 20 of Lasix a day along with potassium every other day.  We will see him back for 
treatment on Wednesday and see him back in about 3 weeks for an office visit.  If he has any 
other questions or concerns, she is welcome to call the clinic at any time.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, high PD-L1 expression.

PRIOR THERAPY:
1. PET/CT scan, February 2015 revealing a 13 mm FDG avid left upper lobe nodule as well as 
left hilar adenopathy.
2. CT-guided left lung biopsy, February 18, 2015, revealed non-small cell lung carcinoma, 
histology unclassified.
3. Mediastinoscopy, April 6, 2018, positive left level 4 lymph node.
4. Received 3 cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin and Alimta, completed May 2015.
5. August 19, 2015, underwent left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node resection 
revealing a 1.5 cm invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, probable acinar type with 2/2 
lymph nodes positive in the left level 5 for T1a N1 disease.
6. Completed sequential chemoradiation with carboplatin and Taxol followed by radiation, 
January 4, 2016, through February 23, 2016.
7. Post-treatment CT scan, May 3, 2016, showed no evidence of residual disease.
8. Developed clinical lymphadenopathy in the left neck with ultrasound on July 26, 2016, 
showing multiple round, slightly enlarged lymph nodes, the largest measuring about 1.4 x 1.3 
and 0.9 cm in size respectively.
9. August 28, 2017, underwent biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph node revealing 
metastatic carcinoma, non-small cell type. Molecular studies were negative for EGFR and ALK-
1. PD-L1 expression was high at 91%-100%.

CURRENT THERAPY:  Pembrolizumab 200 mg q.21 days, cycle 1, day 1 on October 3, 2017.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Rupich is a 58-year-old gentleman who presents to clinic today for 
continued followup of his history of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma with 
adenocarcinoma histology.  He has currently been on single-agent pembrolizumab for about a 
year and half and has having almost complete remission.  Recently, he has had an upper 
respiratory viral-like infection about 3-week interval and lot of difficulty with how he feels.  
Overall, he has had some increased swelling in his lower extremity.  He has had decreased 
interest in food and appetite.  He has again lost about 5 pounds over the last month and half or 
so.  He is actually up a pound from last visit we saw him, however.  He still has some 
macrocytosis and some elevated LFTs, although improving.  He again declares that he is not 
drinking any alcohol at this time.  In the past, recall he has had significant difficulty with alcohol 
abuse.

                                    OFFICE NOTE

 DIAGNOSES:
1.  Small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage, presenting as mediastinal adenopathy.  He 
has now completed 3 cycles of VP-16 and carboplatin with cycles 2 and 3, utilizing concurrent 
radiation.
2.  History of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, EGFR, ALK negative 
with mutated KRAS at presentation.  He underwent surgical resection September 2012, with 
what appeared to be a locally advanced process with path demonstrating involvement of 7 of 14 
lymph nodes.  Postop, he completed 4 cycles of adjuvant Alimta and cisplatin, but unfortunately 
was found to have brain mets September 2013, for which he completed gamma knife.  In 
January 2018, there was a concern for a new right lung lesion, prompting a PET scan that 
confirmed uptake followed by CyberKnife to the lung lesion x3 in April 2018 by Dr. Steven 
Burton.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  John returns with his wife for followup.  He continues to 
tolerate chemo RT reasonably well and in fact received his last radiation treatment today.  He 
denies new bone pain or headache, but has bouts of lightheadedness.  Deep breathing appears 
to help this.  He denies new bone pain, headache, or abdominal pain, but he is unfortunately 
smoking occasionally.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The remainder of his 11-point review of systems was negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 159/80, weight up to 201.  Pain score is 0, ECOG performance 
status 1.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
NECK:  Supple.
LYMPH NODE:  Negative.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
BACK:  Without CVA or spine tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal and intact.

DIAGNOSTICS:  Labs dated July 9, 2019, white count 6.4, hemoglobin 12.0, platelet count 
15,000, BUN and creatinine at that time were 12 and 0.86 respectively.  Labs dated June 25, 
2019, CEA was down to 7.8.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage, for which he is completing chemoradiation 
with his fourth cycle of VP carbo scheduled for today.
2.  Distant history of non-small cell lung cancer as outlined.
PLAN:  At this point, I have recommended moving forward with his next round of chemotherapy 
if labs permit.  I will plan followup in 6-7 weeks preceded by a PET/CT and brain MRI at which 
point if there is a complete response and no evidence for brain issues, we can consider the role 
of prophylactic cranial irradiation, if he is deemed a candidate in light of his previous brain 
metastases.  This can be further discussed with Dr. Mehta in the future.  I have again reviewed 
side effects after which it was his decision to move forward.

 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with solitary CNS metastases.
2.  Recent pneumonia.

CURRENT TREATMENT:  Observation.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  This is a pleasant gentleman, who I am seeing in followup.  He is a 
previous patient of Dr. Volkin.  He was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer in February 
2012.  He was found to have a solitary CNS metastases at the time of diagnosis.  He was seen 
by Dr. Lunsford and underwent gamma knife with a complete clearing of the lesion outside of 
some scar tissue.  He then underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol, 
which revealed stage IIA disease.  He underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with Alimta and 
carboplatin for another 4 cycles.  Since then, he has been in complete remission.  He was 
diagnosed with bilateral pneumonias as well as rhinovirus infection at the end of January as well 
as some vertigo for which he saw Dr. Elford.  The vertigo has completely resolved.  His 
breathing is normalized.  He feels like he is basically back to normal.  He denies chest pain, 
shortness of breath, new nausea or vomiting, new neurologic changes, slurred speech, 
weakness, numbness, tingling, or blood in his urine or stool.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed in his 
original consult note dated February 17, 2012, as above, otherwise unchanged.

MEDICATIONS AND ALLERGIES:  Reviewed and updated in the chart.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Full review of systems was performed, as above, otherwise 
completely negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.7, blood pressure 130/63, pulse 70, respirations 16.
GENERAL:  He is awake and alert, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Moist mucous membrane.  Tongue is midline.  OP is clear.  No scleral icterus.
NECK:  Supple.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes or crackles.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  No rebound or guarding.  No obvious fluid wave.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused.  No obvious bruising or petechiae.
LYMPHATICS:  I did not feel any palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy.

LABORATORY DATA:  CT of the chest on July 20, 2019, showed parenchymal change in right 
lower lung that is improved with some residual opacification still remaining suggestive of 
resolving inflammatory or infectious process.  However, recommendation for followup non-
contrast CT of the chest in 6 months.  CMP on July 22, 2019, was essentially normal.  White 
count 7.4, hemoglobin 14.8, platelets 183,000.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a pleasant gentleman with a history of stage IV non-small 
cell lung cancer.  He continues to be in remission.  We had talked last time about repeating his 
MRI in the fall, which I will order today.  I will also likely need to repeat a CT scan in 6 months 
per radiology recommendation.  He is, otherwise, doing well.  Let us know if anything changes.  
I will see him back in 3 months after the MRI.

 DIAGNOSES:
1.  Small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage, presenting as mediastinal adenopathy 
for which he completed 4 cycles of VP-16 and carboplatin with cycles 2 and 3, utilizing 
concurrent radiation.
2.  Distant history of a stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, EGFR and 
ALK negative with mutated KRAS at presentation.  He initially underwent surgical resection 
in September 2012, with what appeared to be a locally advanced process with path 
demonstrating involvement of 7 of 14 lymph nodes.  Postop, he completed 4 cycles of 
adjuvant Alimta and cisplatin, but unfortunately was found to have brain metastases in 
September 2013 for which he received gamma knife.  In January 2018, there was concern 
for a new right lung lesion, prompting a PET scan that confirmed uptake, followed by 
CyberKnife to the lesion x3 in April 2018, after which he entered in observation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  John returns for followup.  Since our last visit, he did 
complete chemoradiation and now has undergone a PET scan, which will be summarized 
below.  He was able to quit smoking in July 24.  He denies new bone pain and actually 
reports his energy levels are improving.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The remainder of his 11-point review of systems was negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 143/88, vital signs otherwise stable.  Pain score is 0.  ECOG 
performance status 0.
HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  EOMI.  Anicteric sclerae, moist mucus 
membranes without exudate, erythema, or hemorrhage.
NECK:  Supple.
LYMPH NODE:  Negative.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular, not tachycardic.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without organomegaly.
BACK:  Without CVA or spine tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal and intact.

DIAGNOSTICS:  Labs dated July 16, 2019, white count 7.1, hemoglobin 11.5, platelet count 
98,000.  CEA at that point was 3.6.  MRI of the brain on August 26, 2019 was negative.  
PET/CT on August 29, 2019 failed to demonstrate new or progressive disease and there 
was marked improvement of the previous studies, although there were still a few slightly 
enlarged nodes and mild PET avidity.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Small cell lung cancer, apparently limited stage as outlined.
2.  Distant history of a non-small cell lung cancer.

PLAN:  At this point, based on the near complete response, I have recommended followup 
with Radiation Oncology to discuss possible prophylactic cranial irradiation, although I am 
not sure he is a candidate given his past history of gamma knife.  At this point, he is 
concerned about the potential for dementia and thus will discuss this further with Dr. Mehta 
prior to making a decision.  From the standpoint of his small cell lung cancer, I have 
recommended a short interval repeat CAT scan in 2 months after which I will decrease to q. 
3-month imaging through year 1.  He will need a q. 6-8 week port flush in the interim and I 
have asked him to keep me informed of new headache, bone pain, abdominal pain, or other 
new health issues.

DATE OF VISIT:      09/11/2019

                                   CONSULTATION

DIAGNOSES: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Now presenting with progressively worsening left 
shoulder pain due to lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum.
ICD-10 CODE: C34.32, C79.51
CONSULTATION: Freda is a 71-year-old white female who is well-known to our department, 
having just recently completed a course of potentially curative radiotherapy to the LLL 1o tumor 
and adjacent left hilum and mediastinum; she did receive 40 Gy of external beam RT following a 
single 10 Gy SBRT treatment administered by Dr. Steve Burton at UPMC Shadyside in 
Pittsburgh (SBRT was discontinued 2o to concern about high potential gastric radiation dose).
Since completing treatment, Freda has been feeling extremely weak and tired. However, her 
most bothersome problem has been progressively worsening pain in her left shoulder. Recent 
radionuclide bone scan (8/30/19) had shown some increased uptake in the inferior aspect of the 
glenoid labrum of the left scapula, corresponding to an area of lytic lesion, which had previously 
been identified on chest CT (6/18/19). This is now felt to be clearly consistent with metastatic 
disease. In addition, focal areas of uptake was seen in left posterior 9th and 10 ribs, which were 
felt to represent healing rib fractures. A subtle focus of increased radionuclide uptake was seen 
in the mid-shaft of the left femur, which was felt to be 2o to possible metastatic lesion. Left 
shoulder MRI (8/23/19), had shown a slightly displaced fracture through the blade of the 
scapula, and there was some bone marrow edema seen along the superior and posterior 
margin of the glenoid process (which could potentially represent metastatic disease).
From a respiratory standpoint, Freda's status has been fairly stable, although she does report 
significant exertional dyspnea even with relatively minimal activity. Unfortunately, her appetite 
has been very poor, and she has lost an additional seven pounds since completing radiotherapy 
on 7/16/19.
MEDICAL/SURGICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: See previous consultation (6/6/19).
EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Weight: 94.4 pounds. Height: 61"". BMI= 17.9 kg/m2. Pulse: 106 min-1. 
Respirations: 16 min-1 (unlabored). Blood Pressure: 155/75 mmHg. Oxygen Saturation= 95% 
(room air at rest). Karnofsky Performance Status= 70%.
SKIN: 1-2+ residual hyperpigmentation posteriorly, no desquamation apparent.
HEENT: Oral cavity without apparent candidiasis.
LYMPH NODES: No adenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or peri-umbilical regions.
CHEST: Trachea midline, no suprasternal fullness.
LUNGS: Clear bilaterally with fairly good aeration and the bronchial breath sounds previously 
present centrally on the left were much less prominent. Peak Expiratory Flow= 130 liters/minute 
(41% predicted).
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm. No audible murmurs or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Non-tender. Liver span= 8.0 cm.
SKELETAL: There is mild-to-moderate tenderness with palpation about the glenoid socket of 
the shoulder joint posteriorly. No pain on upward percussion of the left humerus. Mild 
tenderness in the mid left femur (~20 cm below the top of the greater trochanter). No other 
significant tenderness with percussion along spinal axis, over the pelvic bones, chest wall 
(including left posterior 9th and 10 ribs), right femur and bilateral humeri.
IMPRESSION: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Freda presents with her first definite manifestation 
of distant metastatic disease, now with progressively worsening left shoulder pain due to 
destructive lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum. She also manifests highly 
suspicious tenderness corresponding to a positive bone scan finding in the left mid-femur (which 
is a ""weight-bearing bone""). 
Detailed discussion was held Freda and her son regarding the indications, technique, potential 
side effects and anticipated results from palliative radiotherapy directed at this left scapular 
metastatic lesion. I stressed to them that her papillary serous endometrial CA has been 
documented previously to be highly radioresponsive in that Joan had achieved essentially 
complete response at the end of 45 Gy pelvic RT, and addition of the ~24 Gy from the Syed 
HDR brachytherapy implant resulted in long-term locoregional tumor control. Furthermore, I 
stressed that since her lower extremity motor strength is essentially fully preserved, and she 
does also retain quite adequate sensory function, I am optimistic that she may be able to regain 
ambulatory status.
Side effects of treatment in Joan's case should be manageable. There may be some possibility 
for radiation esophagitis due to exit dose from treating the thoracic spine; this can usually be 
managed effectively with oral topical anesthetic agents (i.e. viscous Lidocaine) and insertion of 
a planned 5-7 day treatment break in mid-treatment course. With treatment to the chest, there 
may also be some risk for radiation pericarditis and/or pneumonitis; both of these conditions are 
usually responsive to corticosteroid therapy. 
At completion of our discussion, Joan and her daughter expressed their understanding of the 
proposed radiotherapy treatment, its goal of pain relief and prevention of further neurologic 
deficits. Joan did sign an informed consent to receive this palliative mid-thoracic spine 
radiotherapy.
PLAN: Joan did undergo CT treatment planning simulation immediately following our 
consultation. We will be undertaking 3D-conformal treatment planning later today in order to 
design a conformal treatment plan to deliver 30 Gy (3.0 Gy x 10 fractions) to the T6-T9 vertebral 
levels encompassing the left paraspinal mass at T7-T8. Total treatment duration will be two-
weeks, but there is a high likelihood that she will require a mid-course treatment break to allow 
for resolution of radiation esophagitis.

DATE OF VISIT:      09/11/2019

                                   CONSULTATION

DIAGNOSES: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Now presenting with progressively worsening left 
shoulder pain due to lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum.
ICD-10 CODE: C34.32, C79.51
CONSULTATION: Freda is a 71-year-old white female who is well-known to our department, 
having just recently completed a course of potentially curative radiotherapy to the LLL 1o tumor 
and adjacent left hilum and mediastinum; she did receive 40 Gy of external beam RT following a 
single 10 Gy SBRT treatment administered by Dr. Steve Burton at UPMC Shadyside in 
Pittsburgh (SBRT was discontinued 2o to concern about high potential gastric radiation dose).
Since completing treatment, Freda has been feeling extremely weak and tired. However, her 
most bothersome problem has been progressively worsening pain in her left shoulder. Recent 
radionuclide bone scan (8/30/19) had shown some increased uptake in the inferior aspect of the 
glenoid labrum of the left scapula, corresponding to an area of lytic lesion, which had previously 
been identified on chest CT (6/18/19). This is now felt to be clearly consistent with metastatic 
disease. In addition, focal areas of uptake was seen in left posterior 9th and 10 ribs, which were 
felt to represent healing rib fractures. A subtle focus of increased radionuclide uptake was seen 
in the mid-shaft of the left femur, which was felt to be 2o to possible metastatic lesion. Left 
shoulder MRI (8/23/19), had shown a slightly displaced fracture through the blade of the 
scapula, and there was some bone marrow edema seen along the superior and posterior 
margin of the glenoid process (which could potentially represent metastatic disease).
From a respiratory standpoint, Freda's status has been fairly stable, although she does report 
significant exertional dyspnea even with relatively minimal activity. Unfortunately, her appetite 
has been very poor, and she has lost an additional seven pounds since completing radiotherapy 
on 7/16/19.
MEDICAL/SURGICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: See previous consultation (6/6/19).
EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Weight: 94.4 pounds. Height: 61"". BMI= 17.9 kg/m2. Pulse: 106 min-1. 
Respirations: 16 min-1 (unlabored). Blood Pressure: 155/75 mmHg. Oxygen Saturation= 95% 
(room air at rest). Karnofsky Performance Status= 70%.
SKIN: 1-2+ residual hyperpigmentation posteriorly, no desquamation apparent.
HEENT: Oral cavity without apparent candidiasis.
LYMPH NODES: No adenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or peri-umbilical regions.
CHEST: Trachea midline, no suprasternal fullness.
LUNGS: Clear bilaterally with fairly good aeration and the bronchial breath sounds previously 
present centrally on the left were much less prominent. Peak Expiratory Flow= 130 liters/minute 
(41% predicted).
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm. No audible murmurs or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Non-tender. Liver span= 8.0 cm.
SKELETAL: There is mild-to-moderate tenderness with palpation about the glenoid socket of 
the shoulder joint posteriorly. No pain on upward percussion of the left humerus. Mild 
tenderness in the mid left femur (~20 cm below the top of the greater trochanter). No other 
significant tenderness with percussion along spinal axis, over the pelvic bones, chest wall 
(including left posterior 9th and 10 ribs), right femur and bilateral humeri.
IMPRESSION: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IV (T2a, N0, M1); LLL adenoCA s/p 10 Gy SBRT 
followed by 40 Gy; EBRT completed 7/16/19. Freda presents with her first definite manifestation 
of distant metastatic disease, now with progressively worsening left shoulder pain due to 
destructive lytic bone metastasis involving inferior left glenoid labrum. She also manifests highly 
suspicious tenderness corresponding to a positive bone scan finding in the left mid-femur (which 
is a ""weight-bearing bone""). 
Detailed discussion was held Freda and her son regarding the indications, technique, potential 
side effects and anticipated results from palliative radiotherapy directed at this left scapular 
metastatic lesion. I stressed to them that her papillary serous endometrial CA has been

DATE OF VISIT:      09/25/2019

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with adenocarcinoma histology 
with a KRAS G13D mutation.
 
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  

1. Initially treated with Carboplatin and Pemetrexed x4 cycles with good response, but 
subsequently progressed after 4 months of observation with osseous involvement. She received 
radiation to the 7th rib and right iliac crest.
2. Treated with 3 cycles of Nivolumab and had radiographic response, but experienced 
treatment-related adverse effect with autoimmune arthritis.
3. Progressed after a period of observation. Received 1 cycle Pembrolizumab but developed 
recurrent autoimmune arthritis and mild colitis as well. She was started on steroids for this and 
symptoms resolved.
4. Enrolled in UPCI protocol 15-116 involving Docetaxel and Trametinib but experienced 
significant nausea and vomiting and was taken off protocol in January 2017.
5. Observed off of treatment until July 19, 2017, with a restaging CT scan showing progression 
of disease with increased pleural and pulmonary parenchymal nodules in the right hemithorax 
and an associated loculated right pleural effusion. She started single-agent Gemcitabine on 
Days 1 and 8 with 21-day cycles. She experienced significant nausea which responded to anti-
emetics and Dexamethasone.
6. She did not qualify for Irinotecan study drug VX-970 as an inhibitor of the ATR, did not qualify 
for clinical trial.
7. She was started on Abraxane on 10/11/17. Her dose was held on 1/31/18 given she reported 
new pain in her ribs.
8. Re-staging scans on 2/7/18. She had an MRI brain which showed new brain metastasis. She 
also had progression of disease in the chest.
9. SRS to her single brain lesion with Dr. Burton and Dr. Engh on 2/21/18.
10. UPVI 17-158 (XMT-1536 in tumors expressing NaPi26) from 4/2018 through 10/2018, 
progression of disease in liver & chest.
11. Started carboplatin/pemetrexed 11/28/18, completed 3 cycles.
12. She was admitted from April 12 to April 16 with progression of disease noted in her liver 
lesions and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
13. Temodar was initiated 5/14/2019. She completed 2 cycles of Temodar 250 mg daily x5 days 
out of a 28-day cycle. Cycle 2 was dose reduced to 200 mg for nausea. She tolerated the dose 
well, however restaging scans were notable for progression of disease. 
14. She was consented for UPCI 18-088 on 7/10/2019, a phase 1 study of an ERK 1/2 inhibitor

 
CURRENT THERAPY:  She is now cycle 2, day 22 of clinical trial 18088, a phase 1 trial of 
ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 in combination with abemaciclib.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND INTERIM HISTORY:  Corinne returns today.  She has 
now been on abemaciclib plus ERK inhibitor now for 3 weeks continuous since dose reduction 
after hospitalization for uncontrolled diarrhea.  Of note, since that time, she has done quite well.  
She was seen 1 week ago.  At that time, she had a new rash and was prescribed 
betamethasone, which she has used on her chest and has now resolved.  She does have 1 
lesion on her forehead, but is otherwise feeling well.  In addition, she has only had 2 episodes of 
diarrhea over the last week for which she took Imodium and is well controlled.  She currently is 
not having any diarrhea at this time.  She does have intermittent nausea, which is at her 
baseline and has not changed.  She continues to take her olanzapine.  She denies any 
constipation.  Her appetite is stable.  She does have, of note, a chronic hiatal hernia, does have 
nausea at baseline.  Her breathing is noted as baseline.  She is not requiring any oxygen at this 
time.  She previously did have mouth sores, which have now resolved.  She had a previous 
macular, non- papular rash, which has also resolved except for isolated lesion on her face.  She 
denies any itching and otherwise denies any fevers, chills, headaches, blurry vision, chest pain.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A complete review of systems was performed in the HPI, is otherwise 
negative.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD, COPD, upper extremity fracture in the past, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, left bundle-branch block, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, pembrolizumab-
induced autoimmune arthralgias, MI, migraine, chronic low-grade nausea secondary to hiatal 
hernia.
 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: L4 vertebroplasty, left Achilles tendon repair, right arm lymph 
node excision, right rotator cuff repair and tubal ligation.

an albumin of 3.2.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  The patient is scheduled for a scan on September 30, 2019.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Corinne is a 65-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer, adenocarcinoma histology with KRAS G13D mutation, status post multiple lines of 
therapy, currently on therapy UPCI protocol 18-088, a phase 1 trial with ERK1/2 inhibitor in 
combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor.  She now returns for evaluation of cycle 2, day 22.  Of note, 
she had her first dose reduction of the abemaciclib to 100 mg she has tolerated therapy quite 
well.  She has only had intermittent diarrhea that is well controlled with Imodium.  Her rash has 
resolved.  Her chronic nausea is at its baseline.  Her blood counts are trending down.  She is, of 
note, due for a research biopsy next Tuesday.  We will have a repeat of her counts on Monday

treatment and evaluation of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology 
with an underlying KRAS G12C mutation and PD-L1 TPS of 60%.
 
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Briefly, she initially presented in June 2017 with a right suprahilar 
mass invading into the mediastinum and obstructing the right pulmonary artery and bronchus.  
The pathology demonstrated the aforementioned findings.  She had a prolonged hospitalization 
for SVC syndrome and was treated with single modality radiotherapy complicated by atrial 
fibrillation with RVR for which she continues on warfarin.  At the conclusion of the 
hospitalization, she received 2 cycles of sequential chemotherapy with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel.  She had unfortunate progression of her disease and was treated in the first line 
setting with single agent pembrolizumab initiated January 11, 2018.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  She is currently presenting for consideration of cycle 33 of single agent 
pembrolizumab therapy.
 
INTERIM HISTORY:  Cathy unfortunately in the interim since we last saw her, has had an 
increase in her baseline social stresses.  Unfortunately, she has been informed by her landlord 
that she will be evicted from her home in the weeks prior to the Christmas holiday.  Subsequent 
to this, she is experiencing a considerable amount of stress in attendant with this, she has been 
having ongoing issues with regard to pain.  She describes the pain predominantly being of the 
lower portion of her breast bone, which is increased with movement.  It is something that she 
has noticed potentially for the last 6 weeks, it is sharp in nature.  She notices it most when she 
changes position in her bed.  She continues to be fatigued; however, still continues to work part-
time as a chef.  She has no lightheadedness or dizziness.  She has a stable appetite and 
weight.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her comprehensive review of systems is as noted and otherwise 
negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Demonstrates a temperature of 96.5.  Her blood pressure is 129/80, pulse rate 
90, respirations 17, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
GENERAL:  She is a Caucasian female in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Reveals mild oropharyngeal erythema without any pustules or pus.
LYMPHATICS:  She has no palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.  No palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  She has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
SKIN:  No ecchymosis or breakdown.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Reveals appropriate mood and affect.
MS: Lower manubrium and right anterior chest wall pain is very reproducible.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  Demonstrate a white count of 3.9, hemoglobin 14.2, platelet count of 
257.  Her comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits.  Her TSH on October 31 was 
10.368 with a free T4 of 1.22.  Her TFTs are pending at the time of this dictation.  She has no 
new radiographic data performed today.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Cathy is a very unfortunate 67-year-old female, presenting for 
ongoing treatment and evaluation of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma 
histology with an underlying KRAS G12C mutation and a PD-L1 TPS of 60%.  She had initial 
metastatic progression after a course of sequential chemoradiotherapy in the setting of 
prolonged hospitalization.  Fortunately in the setting of her pembrolizumab therapy initiated 
January 11, 2018, she has had essentially a complete response to therapy.  She last had 
imaging of her chest, abdomen and pelvis October 31, 2019, and left lower extremity on August 
7, 2019 with essentially no evidence of disease.  It is notable that we do intermittent left lower 
extremity CT due to her having had disease progression there previously.  With regard to her 
disease-related symptoms, she continues to have mild fatigue; however, is able fortunately to 
continue to work.  She does have a number of social stressors and in this setting that she is 
having increased chest pain, which does historically sound consistent with musculoskeletal 
pain.  In addition to this that the pain is very reproducible on exam today, and I think could 
potentially be due to costochondritis.  It is also notable that on her CT scan on October 31, she 
did have some evidence of post-radiation changes within the manubrium and right anterior ribs, 
which could potentially be accounting for the pain.  She continues to follow with Palliative Care, 
specifically Susan Jessell for the pain and I will be touching base with her or one of our 
colleague just to see whether there are any additional maneuvers that could be done for the 
pain.  Otherwise, she previously has not been on nonsteroidal therapy since she is on 
Coumadin.  I think that it is reasonable to try a low-dose antisteroidal such as Advil at a 
maximum of 400 mg 2-3 times a day to be taken with food.  This could potentially be enough to 
resolve the pain if it is indeed costochondritis.  I did counsel with regard to the potential risk for 
bleeding associated with this, though I think that if at low-dose taken with food the risk is fairly 
low.  We will otherwise proceed with pembrolizumab therapy today with plans to see her back in 
3 weeks' time for her next cycle and plans for interim restaging at a 12 week interval.  
Otherwise, she does have a number of factors, which could potentially suggest that she has 
osteoporosis, specifically with regard to some vertebral height loss noted in the last CT scan 
and she actually has required prior kyphoplasty for this.  In this setting, I would recommend a 
DEXA scan; however, would defer this to her primary care physician.  We will try to reach out to 
them in order to facilitate this.

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with squamous cell histology 
with an underlying PD-L1 TPS of 2%.
   
CURRENT THERAPY:  Recently status post 3 cycles of Carboplatin, Abraxane and Keytruda.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Joann returns to the clinic today for a followup visit accompanied by her 
husband and her daughter.  She recently completed 3 cycles of carboplatin, Abraxane and 
Keytruda with Abraxane dosed on days #1 and day #8.  She had restaging CT scans completed 
this morning.  She actually feels a bit clinically improved since starting systemic therapy.  She 
was having fairly significant left shoulder pain at the time of diagnosis likely secondary to her left 
upper lobe mass, which has actually resolved over the last week.  She has noted somewhat of a 
decreased appetite since starting systemic therapy with minimal weight loss.  She endorses 
very mild nausea, which is responsive to her as needed antiemetic medications.  She denies 
any vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.  She reports that she is eating 4-5 small frequent meals 
throughout the day.  She does endorse a bit of fatigue associated with the chemotherapy, but 
there were no significant changes in her activity level over the last several months.  She had 
issues with transaminitis following cycle #1 of therapy and did not receive Keytruda with cycle 
#2. Keytruda was reintroduced for cycle #3 of therapy with no issues.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Comprehensive review of systems is as noted in the HPI and is 
otherwise negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 96.5 pounds, temperature 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 66, 
respirations 16, blood pressure 145/61.  Fatigue assessment 0.  Pain assessment 0.
GENERAL:  Well-appearing elderly Caucasian female, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Sclerae are anicteric.
LYMPHATICS:  No tender or palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation, decreased breath sounds.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Digital clubbing.  No lower extremity edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented.  Gait not assessed secondary to her being in a wheelchair.
SKIN:  No ecchymosis or breakdown.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Appropriate mood and affect.
 
LABORATORY DATA:  CBC reveals hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.8, and platelets 143,000.  
CMP reveals sodium 134, potassium decreased at 3.2, creatinine at 0.6.  TSH and T3 are within 
normal limits.
 
RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:  Joann had restaging CT scans completed this morning, which per our 
review showed  a significant amount of central necrosis.  Her spleen again shows an increase in 
size, but does appear to be somewhat centrally necrotic.  There was no new evidence of 
metastatic disease, but we will follow the final radiology report and alert her of any changes.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Joann is a very pleasant 82-year-old female with metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer with squamous cell histology with an underlying PD-L1 TPS of 2%.  She 
recently received her third cycle of carboplatin, Abraxane and Keytruda.  Fortunately, she is 
overall feeling a bit improved clinically since starting systemic therapy.  She has had near 
complete resolution of her left-sided shoulder pain, which was present at her diagnosis.  We did 
review the scans with Joann and her family today discussing increasing size of  the splenic 
metastasis.  Given the significant amount of central necrosis in both lesions in combination with 
her clinically feeling a bit improved we opted to continue with cycle #4 of carboplatin, Abraxane 
and Keytruda followed by 2 cycles of maintenance Keytruda with restaging CT scans again at a 
9-week interval.  Should there be confirmed progression of her disease, we would alter her 
treatment course at that point in time.  Joann and her family were amenable with the plan.  We 
did discuss hypokalemia today and she will plan to increase her dietary intake of potassium. 
She has close interval followup with Dr. Smith next week for cycle #4 of therapy.  If she has any 
sort of functional decline or symptomatic decline prior to her next set of imaging in 9 weeks, we 
encouraged them to contact the clinic sooner.  All of her questions were answered to their 
satisfaction.
 
END OF DICTATED REPORT BY PA-C.  ATTENDING MD COMMENT BELOW.
 
I have personally spoken with the patient, reviewed today's PA-C's progress note for this patient 
and agree with the findings as documented.  Today the key element(s) of service that I 
personally provided are as follows:
 
Joann has concern for radiographically progressive disease though fortunately clinically is 
improved. Given the significant clinical benefit and in hopes this is radiographically pseudo-
progression we will proceed with therapy at this point in time with short interval follow-up as 
stated above.  I have been in touch with Dr. Smith to discuss the case.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

DIAGNOSIS:  Non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.

ICD CODE:  C34.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Afaq Ahmad, MD; Steven A Burton, MD; Ranga Patri, MD; Inderpal 
S Sarkaria, MD;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Margaret Umbel is a 55-year-old female who returns to 
Radiation Oncology Clinic for regular followup.  She had 2 radiation oncology treatment one in 
July 2018, stereotactic body radiation therapy to the left lung lesions, 54 Gy in 3 fractions by Dr. 
Burton at Shadyside Hospital.  Then, she developed recurrent/second malignancy in the chest 
in 2018 by PET/CT scan on December 4, 2018, showing left upper lobe, mediastinal, and 
internal mammary node lesions for which she received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, 60 
Gy in 30 fractions, completed on March 19, 2019.  She had a PET/CT scan in June 2019, which 
showed significant decrease of FDG-avid lesions near complete remission.  A repeat PET/CT 
scan on February 4, 2020, shows no evidence of tumor or significant radiation related side 
effect in the thorax.  She does not have fever, night sweating, or weight loss.  She does not 
have unusual headache, osseous pain except for chronic back pain for which she takes 
ibuprofen.  She currently smokes small amount of cigarette.  She uses oxygen when it is 
needed at home.  She has chronic shortness of breath, but denies unusual cough or 
hemoptysis.  She does not have gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptomatologies.  She 
denies visual, hearing, or speech impairment.  She denies gait abnormality.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  She appears to be in good condition, alert and oriented, in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  She weighs 117 pounds, temperature 98.6 Fahrenheit, pulse 102, blood 
pressure 126/68, respirations 22, and oxygen saturation 93% at ambient air.
HEENT:  There is no facial asymmetry.  Extraocular movement is normal.
NECK:  There is no lymphadenopathy in the neck.
LUNGS:  Showing very limited air movement with scattered wheezing, consistent with COPD.
HEART:  Showing regular rhythm without murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Unremarkable.  There is mild punch tenderness in the spine.

IMPRESSION:  Margaret Umbel is doing well, although she has chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease for which she requires oxygen when it is needed.  Today, oxygen saturation is 93% at 
ambient air.  Therefore, we encouraged her to see a pulmonologist and home 
oxygenation/continuous oxygen therapy.  We recommended her to return to Radiation Oncology 
Clinic in 6 months for followup examination.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

Ms. Pearson is a 76-year-old female seen for a followup visit in the office today.  This is her first 
visit after completing radiation therapy to the right lung.  Pathology showed adenocarcinoma.  
The stage of her disease was T1cN0M0.  The patient was not a good surgical candidate partly 
because of a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.  Therefore, radiation therapy was recommended.  
She received 60 Gy in 15 fractions.  She completed her course of treatment on December 4, 
2019.
 
The patient states she continues following with Dr. Timothy Lucas.  She was seen by Dr. Lucas 
about a month ago and has a followup appointment next week.  The patient continues to have a 
cough.  She has shortness of breath.  She states her pulmonary symptoms are essentially 
unchanged.  She states at times she feels as though she wheezes, but again states this is 
unchanged.  She has no chest pain or pain with inspiration.  The patient states she has 
headaches, which she was told were related to her neck tightness and multiple sclerosis.  The 
patient states Dr. Mark Lipitz discussed an infusion with her; however, she would have to be 
""cancer free"" before she could have injection.  The patient states her appetite is good, and she 
is able to tolerate a regular diet.  The patient states she has a suprapubic catheter and she has 
some tenderness around her suprapubic catheter.  She states that her catheter will be changed 
tomorrow.  She goes on to state that she follows with an Infectious Disease specialist in State 
College.  She is constantly on antibiotics and they are changed every few weeks.  The patient 
states she is currently on Levaquin, but her antibiotic will soon be changed.  Her review of 
systems is otherwise unremarkable.
 
On exam, the patient is unable to be weighed.  The patient is in a wheelchair and cannot stand.  
Pulse is 84 and regular.  Respirations are 18 and unlabored.  Blood pressure is 151/74.  No 
cervical or clavicular lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  The patient's heart is regular rate and 
rhythm.  Her lungs are clear, but distant bilaterally.
 
I had the opportunity to review the patient's CT of the chest with Dr. Schocker before the 
patient's appointment today.  The patient's last CT was on February 27, 2020.  The irradiated 
area appears stable.  The patient had multiple lung nodules described; however, they appear to 
have either remained stable or decreased in size.
 
The situation was reviewed with the patient.  There is no clear evidence of recurrent or 
metastatic disease on the patient's imaging.  The patient understands it is essential that we 
continue to monitor her closely.  A CT of the chest was requested in three months, and we will 
see the patient back in our office after her scan.  The patient was encouraged to continue 
following with her other medical providers.  This was discussed and agreed upon with Dr. Jack 
Schocker.  Dr. Mark Alden was available during the patient's appointment today.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

DIAGNOSIS: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IIIB-IIIC (T2-3, N3, M0, G2); 5 cm LLL/left hilar MD 
squamous cell CA in left mainstem bronchus with complete occlusion of LLL lobar bronchus 
with obstructive atelectasis. Adenopathy in sub-carinal, pre-tracheal and left hilar regions noted 
on CT angiogram.
ICD-10 CODE: C34.32, C77.1

FOLLOW-UP:  Frank is a now almost 64-year-old white male, who is seen in follow-up today 
six-weeks since he completed 60 Gy of definitive IMRT Thoracic Radiotherapy back on 6/4/20. 
Frank had received concurrent low-dose weekly chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC= 2) and 
paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) per Dr. Penland. We are very gratified to learn that Frank has been doing 
extremely well since finishing radiotherapy treatment. He reports that the considerable skin 
irritation (with intense pruritus) that he had been experiencing on his back, cleared almost 
completely within about the first two-weeks post-completion. Frank's respiratory status is also 
significantly improved; he said he can now readily climb two flights of stairs without stopping to 
rest, and he really does not notice that his pulmonary status limits his activities in any way. His 
appetite is good, his weight is stable and his only GI complaint is some mild constipation. Frank 
is back to working intermittently in his shop doing small engine repair. He did see Dr. Penland in 
Medical Oncology follow-up on 6/30/20; he received his initial dose of Durvalumab at that time, 
with his second dose given recently on 7/14/20, and the next dose due for 7/28/20. Frank says 
the Durvalumab has been very well tolerated, with exception of some very mild fatigue on the 
day of administration.

VITAL SIGNS: Weight: 127.6 lbs (decreased 6.0 lbs since completion). Height: 65"". BMI= 21.2 
kg/m2. BSA= 1.63 m2. Pulse: 104 min-1. Respirations: 20 min-1 (unlabored). Blood Pressure: 
124/77 mmHg. Oxygen Saturation= 98% (room air). Karnofsky Performace Status= 90%
SKIN: Trace-1+ residual hyperpigmentation posteriorly, withput remaining dry desquama 1+ 
anteriorly.
LYMPH NODES: No adenopathy palpable in cervical, supraclavicular or axillary regions. 
CHEST: Trachea remains in the midline (was initially displaced at least 2 cm to left of the 
midline prior to initial chemotherapy), with no suprasternal fullness to suggest superior 
mediastinal adenopathy. Lungs are clear bilaterally with complete resolution of the bronchial 
breath sounds heard in the LUL. Left lung now entirely clear with resolution of the soft pleural 
rub heard laterally along superior aspect of the LLL. Left lung base is clear, good aeration. 
Percussion demonstrates resonance at both lung bases. Diaphragm excursion remains almost 
1.5 cm at maximal inspiration.
HEART: Regular rhythm. No audible murmurs, gallops or pericardial rubs.
ABDOMEN: Non-tender. Liver span = 8.5 cm. Splenic span = 7.0 cm. No abdominal mass 
including the LUQ (where a small left adrenal nodule had been seen on CT).. 
EXTREMITIES: No acrocyanosis, digital clubbing or peripheral edema is noted. Hand veins 
collapse readily with elevation of the hands above shoulder level.
SKELETAL: No bone tenderness
IMPRESSION: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IIIC (T3, N3, M0, G2); Frank remains clinically no 
evidence of disease, now six-weeks post-completion of definitive thoracic chemoradiation 
therapy. Frank's acute and subacute radiation reactions are resolving appropriately.
 

PLAN: We have arranged for Frank to undergo post-treatment PET/CT scan in early-9/20 
(which would be about 12-14 weeks after completion of radiation) to allow for complete 
lymphoid recovery in his mediastinum so as to avoid a false-positive PET scan. Frank will 
continue receiving the Durvalumab on a q2 weekly basis going forward. We will plan to see 
Frank again in Radiation Oncology followup on 5/26/21 and we would also anticipate obtaining 
repeat PET/CT scan in the spring sometime in late-3/21.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

DIAGNOSIS: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IIIB-IIIC (T2-3, N3, M0, G2); 5 cm LLL/left hilar MD 
squamous cell CA in left mainstem bronchus with complete occlusion of LLL lobar bronchus 
with obstructive atelectasis. Adenopathy in sub-carinal, pre-tracheal and left hilar regions noted 
on CT angiogram.
ICD-10 CODE: C34.32, C77.1

FOLLOW-UP:  Frank is a now almost 64-year-old white male, who is seen in follow-up today 
six-weeks since he completed 60 Gy of definitive IMRT Thoracic Radiotherapy back on 6/4/20. 
Frank had received concurrent low-dose weekly chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC= 2) and 
paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) per Dr. Penland. We are very gratified to learn that Frank has been doing 
extremely well since finishing radiotherapy treatment. He reports that the considerable skin 
irritation (with intense pruritus) that he had been experiencing on his back, cleared almost 
completely within about the first two-weeks post-completion. Frank's respiratory status is also 
significantly improved; he said he can now readily climb two flights of stairs without stopping to 
rest, and he really does not notice that his pulmonary status limits his activities in any way. His 
appetite is good, his weight is stable and his only GI complaint is some mild constipation. Frank 
is back to working intermittently in his shop doing small engine repair. He did see Dr. Penland in 
Medical Oncology follow-up on 6/30/20; he received his initial dose of Durvalumab at that time, 
with his second dose given recently on 7/14/20, and the next dose due for 7/28/20. Frank says 
the Durvalumab has been very well tolerated, with exception of some very mild fatigue on the 
day of administration.

                                   CONSULTATION

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. David Friedland
 
REASON FOR REFERRAL: Lung SBRT

ICD CODE:  C34.32
 
STAGE:  T1b N0 M0, stage IA2
  
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left lower lobe early stage lung cancer.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Benning is a 61- year- old man who initially had stage 
IIIA non-small cell lung cancer of the right upper lobe.  He was treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, right upper lobe lobectomy with mediastinal nodal dissection and postoperative 
chemoradiotherapy, 60 Gy in 30 fractions, which was completed on October 28, 2016.  He now 
has two left lower lobe pulmonary nodules that are conspicuous on imaging, for which he is 
referred for SBRT.  Regarding his initial stage IIIA lung cancer, he was found to have PD-L1 
expression of 80% as well as C-MET amplification.  In the months following chemoradiotherapy, 
he was found to have 3 concerning nodules in the left lung that were questionable for discrete 
primary tumors versus related to the initial right lung cancer.  Over the past 3-1/2 years, he was 
treated on UPCI 17-121 and had excellent response to immunotherapy with complete resolution 
of a nodule in the left upper lung.  In fact, he received durvalumab maintenance therapy until 
March 16, 2020, when it was discontinued in response to LFT elevation.  On July 14, 2020, he 
saw Dr. Friedland in follow up.  Surveillance CT of the chest and abdomen at that time showed 
no signs of disease below the diaphragm.  There are apparent post-surgical and post-radiation 
changes in the right lung and in the left lower lobe there are 2 nodules that have been followed 
since 2017 and likely represent discrete primary tumors.  I am asked to consider 
radiotherapeutic options for management of these left lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies cough.  Denies shortness of breath.  Denies fatigue.  A 12 -
point review of systems was obtained and was entirely negative.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died at age 63 of lung cancer.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former smoker, history of alcohol abuse.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  KPS 100, seated comfortably in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 72, respirations 16, blood pressure 132/83, oxygen 
saturation 98%.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Wearing a mask over oropharynx.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably in room air.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  No peripheral 
edema.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.
 
IMAGING:  Most recent CT chest from July 14, 2020, shows two left lower lobe nodules, one 
measuring 1.6 x 1.3 cm, which is on series 4, image 100 and then the other nodule measures 
0.9 x 0.6 cm and is at approximately the same level, but more anterior.  These have remained 
visible on imaging since 2017, whereas other suspicious lesions have entirely resolved.  There 
are no suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes nor is there any sign of metastatic disease, nor is 
there any evidence of disease recurrence of the right upper lobe disease.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 61- year- old man initially with right upper lobe, stage IIIA 
lung cancer treated with chemotherapy, surgery and chemoradiotherapy, who afterwards had 
suspicious lymph nodes and several pulmonary nodules in question, found on surveillance 
imaging, then received a long course of immunotherapy.  Notably, his PD-L1 expression was 
80%.  Over the last few years while other areas of suspicion have entirely resolved, there are 2 
left lower lobe pulmonary nodules in question for which I am asked to consider SBRT.  We 
discussed that the goal of radiotherapy would be to achieve local control of these pulmonary 
nodules, which appear to be unrelated to the initial disease in the right upper lobe.  I explained 
that SBRT radiotherapy is typically delivered in 3-5 fractions, based on the volume we are 
required to treat as well as the proximity of critical structures, such as the esophagus, heart and 
chest wall.  We discussed that in this situation based on the size of the tumors and the distance 
from the esophagus and heart, I think that his risk of esophagitis, pericarditis and pneumonitis 
are fortunately quite low.  We discussed options available to him, which include observation, 
although after considering the risks versus benefits of SBRT in detail, he would like to proceed 
with radiotherapy as recommended.  I explained the need for a complex simulation with motion 
management in order to ensure that we are delivering the best treatment possible considering 
that these tumors will likely move during the phases of respiration.  We discussed some of the 
technical challenges that sometimes arise from treating 2 tumors in the same organ and we will 
have to decide whether or not to use a 2 isocenter versus 1 isocenter approach.  I reviewed the 
recent CT scan with him in the office and showed him the size and location of the nodules.  He 
understands the specific goals, rationale, risks and team based approach of SBRT radiotherapy. 
I will arrange for his simulation and he will let us know if any questions or concerns arise.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient returns.  He is doing a bit better, still needing 
some blood transfusion.  We did get him cleared for full-dose Aranesp therapy and see if we 
can combat his anemia.  He otherwise had a good checkup with the cardiologist and they feel 
he is recovering very nicely.  His scalp lesions and cervical lymphadenopathy have resolved 
and it appears he is having some response to his chemoimmunotherapy at this point in time and 
he clinically looks a lot better than he has.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No recent admission.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No recent procedures.

MEDICATIONS:  Please see current medication list.

ALLERGIES:  Reviewed and unchanged.

FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 12-system review is negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  He presents as a 76-year-old Caucasian male in stable health.
HEENT:  Revealed complete resolution of the scalp lesion.
LYMPHATICS:  He had no cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS:  Clear.
HEART:  Rhythm is regular.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits.
ABDOMEN:  Revealed no hepatosplenomegaly, no palpable intra-abdominal masses.  No 
inguinal adenopathy was noted.
EXTREMITIES:  No major arthropathy, deformity, or edema of the lower extremities.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Non-small cell carcinoma of the lung.
2.  History of colon cancer.
3.  History of prostate cancer.
4.  History of cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure, improved.

PLAN:  At the present time, he has had a clinical improvement.  We will go ahead and get his 
next cycle of chemoimmunotherapy, underway we can also treat him with darbepoetin therapy 
and see if we can reduce the number of transfusions he is experiencing up to this point.  
Overall, though he is showing significant improvement and hopefully some evidence of a good 
tumor response at this point in time.

surgery.
3.  Low-grade papillary cancer resected May 2019, by Dr. Hrebinko in Pittsburgh.
4.  Elevated cholesterol.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, still smoking.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mr. Orlando is doing fairly well.  He is trying to quit smoking.  He is 
asking about the nicotine supplements and vaporing.  He has verbalized no complaints.  His 
cholesterol was high as I had checked in a while.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A 10-point review of systems is negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Alert, pleasant male, good performance status.
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 120/60, pulse ox 96%, pulse is 47, and weight is 240.
HEENT:  Benign.
CHEST:  Clear.
CARDIAC:  Benign.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, no organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Normal.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 His recent PET scan had pulmonary nodules that was not PET active, it was about 4 mm.  I 
personally reviewed the films.  I ordered a repeat CT scan of the chest in 4 months.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  I will check a fasting cholesterol profile, send it to labs to Dr. R. 
Murthy, his cardiologist.  Encouraged Mr. Orlando to quit smoking. 

 Call if his problems, be COVID safe.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Liza Villaruz.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Right upper lobe presumed non-small cell lung cancer.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.11.
 
INTERVAL SINCE TREATMENT:  Three months.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman with a history of prior 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for left upper lobe non-small cell lung 
cancer.  She was then developed an enlarging right upper lobe nodule.  MRI brain and PET/CT 
were negative for disease elsewhere.  Biopsy was suboptimal sampling, but showed atypical 
cells, SUV uptake was 4.33 on September 22, 2020, PET/CT.  The nodule in question was 
treated with SBRT 48 Gy in 4 fractions from October 27, 2020 to November 4, 2020.  Treatment 
was well tolerated without acute side effects. Following receipt of SBRT,  she also had no side 
effects: no cough, no fatigue, no shortness of breath.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies lack of appetite, denies fever, denies cough, denies 
hemoptysis, denies chest pain.  Twelve -point review of systems was obtained and was 
negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  ECOG 1.  Seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 93, respirations 16, blood pressure 114/71, oxygen 
saturation 98% on supplemental oxygen.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Oropharynx obscured by mask.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably on supplemental oxygen.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCH:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.  
 
IMAGING:  I personally reviewed the available imaging consisting of a CT chest without contrast 
obtained earlier today, which shows that the treated right upper lobe nodule has nearly 
completely resolved.  There is only minimal linear opacification along the minor fissure left in its 
place.  There is no sign of radiation pneumonitis, nor fibrosis.  There is no sign of disease 
elsewhere.  Overall, this is a favorable response to treatment.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman who underwent SBRT 48 
Gy in 4 fractions for an empiric non-small cell lung cancer, although did have atypical cells on 
the biopsy specimen.  She has had almost a complete response to SBRT.  She is without any 
side effects attributable to radiotherapy.  We will continue to follow and plan to see her back in 3 
months in coordination with Dr. Villaruz.

PATIENT ID#:        075394405
DATE OF BIRTH:      05/01/1960
DATE OF VISIT:      03/02/2021

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

DIAGNOSIS: Left Lung CA, Clinical Stage IIIB (T3, N2, M0, G3); 6.4 x 4.3 x 5.6 cm LLL 1o 
tumor with massive 7.5 x 5.7 x 6.1 cm left hilar nodal mass (extending along mainstem 
bronchus almost to carina) and 2.5 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm AP window adenopathy.
ICD-10 CODES: C34.32, C77.1

 
FOLLOW-UP:  Richard is a 60-year-old white male who returns in follow-up today, now six-
weeks since he completed 60 Gy of definitive radiotherapy to LLL 1o tumor and adjacent left 
hilar and AP window adenopathy back on 1/19/21. Of note, Richard did receive 6 full weekly 
cycles of carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) per Dr. Penland, concurrent with his 
thoracic RT.  

Today, we are very gratified to learn that Richard has been doing quite well since completing 
treatment. He had experienced some worsening of his radiation esophagitis symptoms during 
the first week post-completion, but this has all resolved completely at this point. Rich also had 
significant improvement in his persistent cough, which had been productive of greenish sputum. 
Over the past two weeks or so, cough has been minimal without any sputum production. 
However, over just the last 4-5 days, Richard has noted some increased cough, again with 
reappearance of yellowish sputum. He had seen Dr. Penland in Medical Oncology follow-up 
earlier today; she has started him on azithromycin 250 mg, to take 500 mg today and then 250 
mg over the next four days for complete course of therapy for presumptive community-acquired 
bronchitis/pneumonia. Dr. Penland is starting him on durvalumab 10 mg/kg to be administered 
on q. 2 weekly basis.
 
Richard states that his exertional SOB is stable to improved, even over just this past week.  His 
appetite has remained fairly good, and he is supplementing this with Carnation Instant 
Breakfast.  He has had essentially no unintentional weight loss.  Richard denies any chest pain 
or orthopnea.  No suspicious, progressively worsening bone pain.  He denies headaches or 
focal neurologic symptoms.
 

EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Weight: 141.6 lbs. (decreased 1.6 lbs since completion 1/19/21). Height: 68"". 
BMI= 21.5 kg/m2. BSA= 1.77 m2. Temperature: 97.2o F. Pulse: 107 min-1. Respirations: 16 min-1 
(unlabored). Blood Pressure: 106/67 mmHg. Oxygen Saturation= 99% (room air at rest). 
Karnofsky Performance Status= 90%.
SKIN: 2+ erythema posteriorly, 1+ anteriorly.
LYMPH NODES: No adenopathy palpable in cervical, supraclavicular or axillary regions. 
CHEST: Trachea midline with no suprasternal fullness. No chest wall tenderness on firm 
palpation. 
LUNGS: Right lung clear. Left lung with complete resolution of the low-pitched wheezes present 
at completion. Good aeration throughout. No dullness appreciated at left lung base (complete 
re-aeration of the previously atelectatic LLL segment). 
HEART: Generally regular rhythm but frequent skipped beats. There is a I/VI systolic murmur. 
No S3 or S4 gallop.
ABDOMEN: Non-tender. Liver span= 8.5 cm. Splenic span= 7.0 cm. No abdominal mass 
(including no pulsatile mass) or suggestion of ascites. 
SKELETAL: No bone tenderness.

IMPRESSION:  Left Lung CA, Stage IIIB (T3, N2, M0, G3); Richard remains clinically no 
evidence of disease six-weeks post-completion of definitive RT, with gratifying resolution of his 
acute radiation side effects. Possible early acute bronchitis, being treated with azithromycin per 
Dr. Penland. Maintenance immunotherapy with durvalumab to be started in the next several 
weeks.
 

PLAN:  We will be scheduling Richard to undergo post-RT PET/CT scan in early-5/21 (allowing 
a full 10-12 weeks for resolution of post-RT lymphoid recovery in irradiated mediastinal lymph 
nodes). Thereafter, we will schedule a second PET/CT scan at six-month interval in early-11/21, 
so as to ensure that he remains in complete remission;. I cautioned Richard and his sister that 
this six-month period between the first and second PET scans is an extremely common time 
frame for tumor recurrence, if it is to recur at all. Accordingly, we will plan to see Richard again 
in Radiation Oncology follow-up in early-12/21, so as to ensure that he remains free from any 
significant late radiation side effects.

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Roy Semaan.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Left upper lobe pulmonary mass, presumed non-small cell lung cancer.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.12.
 
INTERVAL SINCE TREATMENT:  Three months.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Following receipt of radiotherapy Ms. Smith has noticed mild left hand 
numbness, but otherwise no symptoms attributable to the receipt of radiotherapy.  Denies new 
onset cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, or any other symptoms.  Overall, is doing 
well and is happy with how she feels considering her interstitial lung disease.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies lack of appetite.  Denies fatigue.  Denies fever.  Denies chest 
pain.  Denies cough.  Twelve -point review of systems was obtained and was negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  KPS 60%.  Seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.2, pulse 88, respirations 16, blood pressure 121/78, oxygen 
saturation 98% on room air.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears, nose appear normal.  Oropharynx obscured by mask.
NECK:  Trachea midline.No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably on oxygen while seated.  Wheezes and decreased lung sounds 
throughout.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATICS:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy 
PSYCHIATRIC:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.
 
IMAGING:  I personally reviewed the available imaging consisting of a CT chest from earlier 
today, which shows a complete response to radiotherapy since the formerly evident left upper 
lobe FDG avid lesion is no longer present.  There is an unchanged left upper lobe irregular 
nodule that bears continued watching, but may represent confluent fibrosis.  There is also a new 
area of nodularity in the right lower lobe lung base measuring 1.2 cm.  Also, there is continued 
watching and is thought likely infectious or inflammatory in nature.  There is continued 
demonstration of UIP pulmonary fibrosis with superimposed emphysema.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Smith is a 52- year- old woman with UIP pulmonary fibrosis 
who was treated empirically with 60 Gy in 10 fractions, completed on December 10th, for a left 
upper lobe presumed non-small cell lung cancer.  She had mild fatigue after treatment and does 
have left hand numbness, but overall is doing well and imaging today shows complete 
resolution of the formerly visualized FDG avid solid mass.  She is very happy with this news.  I 
will see her back in 3 months with a repeat CT chest.  We will continue to monitor the other 
areas of suspicion which may represent confluent fibrosis.  She will contact me in the meantime 
if questions or concerns arise.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Liza Villaruz.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  Right upper lobe presumed non-small cell lung cancer.
 
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.11.
 
INTERVAL SINCE TREATMENT:  Seven months.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman with a history of prior 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for left upper lobe non-small cell lung 
cancer.  She then developed an enlarging right upper lobe nodule.  MRI brain and PET/CT were 
negative for disease elsewhere.  A biopsy was suboptimal sampling, but showed atypical cells, 
SUV uptake was 4.33 on September 22, 2020, PET/CT.  Therefore, we presumed the right 
upper lobe nodules represented non-small cell lung cancer.  It was treated empirically with 
SBRT, 48 Gy in 4 fractions from October 27, 2020 to November 4, 2020.  Treatment was well 
tolerated without acute side effects.  I last saw her on February 9, 2021 when we reviewed a 
month post-treatment CT chest, which showed the treated right upper lobe nodule to have 
nearly completely resolved.  There was only minimal linear opacification along the minor fissure, 
left in its place.  There was no sign of radiation pneumonitis, nor fibrosis.  There was no sign of 
disease elsewhere.  I now see her back 7 months after treatment.  Overall, she is feeling well 
without any new pulmonary symptoms; however, she does notice increased fatigue for the last 
month, which may be saying however, she is still able to take care of her grandson and do 
many activities of daily living, although becomes tired and short of breath more easily.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies cough.  Denies hemoptysis.  Denies headache.  Denies vision 
changes.  Denies lack of appetite.  Denies fever.  Confirms fatigue.  Denies chest pain.  Denies 
palpitations.  A 12 -point review of systems was obtained and was otherwise negative.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  ECOG 1, seated comfortably, in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 99, respirations 16, blood pressure 107/72, O2 sat 98% on nasal cannula 
oxygen.
EYES:  Anicteric sclerae.  No lid lag.  PERRL.
ENT:  Ears and nose appear normal.  Oropharynx obscured by mask.
NECK:  Trachea midline.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Breathing comfortably on supplemental oxygen.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
LYMPHATIC:  No appreciable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy.
PSYCH:  Alert and oriented x3, appropriate affect.
 
IMAGING:  I personally reviewed the available imaging consisting of a CT chest obtained earlier 
today, which shows the treated right upper lobe nodule to now be completely resolved.  There is 
only minimal residual mild opacification that is hardly evident.  There is no sign of radiation 
pneumonitis nor fibrosis.  There is no sign of disease elsewhere.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Witherite is a 66- year- old woman who underwent SBRT, 48 
Gy in 4 fractions for a presumed non-small cell lung cancer, although biopsy was technically 
negative, it showed atypical cells.  She has now had a complete response to SBRT.  She is 
without any attributable side effects.  I will see her back in 5 months with a repeat CT chest in 
coordination with Dr. Villaruz.  Ms. Witherite will contact me in the meantime if questions or 
concerns arise.

PRINCIPAL  DIAGNOSIS:   Squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  extensive 
mediastinal,  right  hilar,  right  supraclavicular,  right  axillary  and  left  cervical 
lymphadenopathy, left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
 
CURRENT THERAPY:  Nivolumab every 4 weeks since August 2016.
 
PRIOR THERAPY: 
1.   The  patient  received  6  cycles  of  carboplatin,  Abraxane,  in  December  2015,  with 
complete response to therapy.
2.   The  patient  underwent  maintenance  erlotinib  for  2  months,  but  she  had  significant 
toxicity and this was stopped.
3.  The patient had disease progression in August 2016, and was started on nivolumab.
 
CURRENT  MEDICATIONS:   Vitamin  C,  benazepril,  vitamin  D,  gemfibrozil,  Synthroid, 
vitamin E, Zantac, aspirin 81 mg daily, multivitamin, zinc and ibuprofen p.r.n.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient presents for followup evaluation in clinic today.  She 
was last seen July 1st, 2021.  Since that time, she continued on nivolumab every four 
weeks.  She has tolerated this well.  Her appetite is good.  Her energy level is adequate.  
She has occasional cough.  She reports no bleeding.  She has had no recent infections.  
She  has  had  no  fevers,  chills,  headache,  shortness  of  breath,  chest  pain,  nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain or urinary symptoms.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except for as described above.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
VITAL  SIGNS:   Temperature  96.6,  heart  rate  77,  respiratory  rate  18,  blood  pressure 
109/75, weight 158 pounds.  Performance status is 0.

HEENT:  No oral lesions.
NECK:  No palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy appreciated.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
PULMONARY:  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.
CHEST:  Right-sided MediPort in place.
ABDOMEN:   Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   Positive  bowel  sounds.   No  palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:   No  edema  of  lower  extremities.   No  cyanosis,  clubbing,  or  calf 
tenderness.
SKIN:  No rash, lesions are identified.
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  No focal neurologic deficits.
 
LABORATORY STUDIES:  From July 1st, white blood cell count 4.9, hemoglobin 12.8, 
hematocrit  38.4,  platelets  151.   Complete  metabolic  profile  is  significant  for  creatinine 
0.66.  Thyroid function testing was normal.
 
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis from August 19th 
showed no evidence of recurrent disease.
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  69-year-old female with a history of metastatic squamous 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  lung  with  extensive  mediastinal  hilar  cervical,  supraclavicular  or 
right axillary lymph node involvement as well as left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, who 
presents  for  follow-up.   She  is  on  second  line  nivolumab  since  August  2016.   She  is 
tolerating  this  well.   I  reviewed  her  CT  of  the  neck,  chest,  abdomen  and  pelvis  from 
August  19th,  which  shows  no  evidence  of  recurrent  disease.   She  will  continue  on 
nivolumab every 4 weeks.  We will continue with intensive monitoring on this therapy for 
her  life  threatening  illness.   She  will  return  to  clinic  in  8  weeks.   She  will  contact  our 
office for any questions or concerns in the interim.

DATE OF BIRTH:      05/31/1941
DATE OF VISIT:      06/15/2021

                                   CONSULTATION

DIAGNOSIS:  Small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, limited stage.
ICD-10 CODE:  C34.32.
REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Dr. Silvia Coleman, Dr. Peter Daloni and Dr. Chad Smith.
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Prophylactic cranial irradiation after completion of systemic 
chemotherapy with complete remission.
Ronald Valentine is an 80-year-old male, who was found to have 2 FDG-avid left lung lesions on 
PET/CT scan October 26, 2020.  One is in the left lower lobe and the other one is in the left 
upper lobe, less than 2 cm in size.  On November 23, 2020, he underwent left VATS, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection, left upper lobe nodule wedge resection and left lower lobe 
nodule wedge resection.  Pathology revealed left upper lobe lesion with squamous cell 
carcinoma, 1.5 cm in size with 1 cm margin.  Left lower lobe wedge resection revealed small cell 
undifferentiated carcinoma, 1.8 cm with 1 mm margin.  Lymph node study was negative.  Then, 
he received 2 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide.  Then, restaging study, April 13th CT scan of 
the chest showed no tumor.  MRI of the brain April 13, 2021, also showed no tumor, thus he 
achieved complete remission of the disease.  He is age 80, but doing reasonably well with good 
cognitive function.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cellulitis; gout; 
hypertension; 2 lung cancers as above; prostate cancer in 2010, treated by external beam 
radiation therapy, currently under control; hypomagnesemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prostate biopsy, external beam radiation therapy to the prostate, 
cardioversion, VATS in November 2020, tonsillectomy.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, colchicine, Coumadin, COVID vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, Lopressor, losartan, Norvasc, ondansetron, prochlorperazine.
ALLERGIES:  HE IS ALLERGIC TO ADHESIVE TAPE.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has smoked 1 pack per day of cigarettes for 2 years and quit 23 years 
ago.  He drinks occasionally and denies illicit drug use.
FAMILY HISTORY:  One sister had lung cancer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  He complains of fatigability, but denies fever, night sweating, or weight 
loss.
INTEGUMENTARY:  Unremarkable without unusual skin lesion.
HEAD:  Unremarkable.
EYES:  He denies double vision or blurred vision.
ENT:  He has some hearing impairment in chronic nature and denies speech impairment.  He 
also denies hoarseness or swallowing difficulty.
RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable with unusual cough or shortness of breath.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  He has atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, but denies chest pain or 
palpitations.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Unremarkable without constipation or rectal bleeding.
GENITOURINARY:  Unremarkable without dysuria or hematuria.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  He has arthritic joint pain, but denies acute bone pain.
ENDOCRINE:  He has gout, but does not have diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorder.
NEUROLOGIC:  He had some hearing impairment might be due to systemic chemotherapy.  He 
also has peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy.  Otherwise, unremarkable without motor 
dysfunction.
HEMATOLOGY:  He denies easy skin bruising.
LABORATORY FINDINGS:  We do not have a recent blood test, but on November 23, 2020, 
sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride 109, BUN 18, creatinine 1.04 and estimated GFR 68.  
WBC 7.8, hemoglobin 10.3, and platelet 175.
IMAGING STUDIES:  I personally reviewed PET/CT scan on October 26, 2020.  MRI of the 
brain and most recent CT of the chest findings are stated in HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Reveals him to be in good general condition for age 80, alert and oriented.
VITAL SIGNS:  He weighs 217 pounds, temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit, pulse 78, respirations 16, 
and oxygen saturation 98%.
HEENT:  There is no facial asymmetry.  Extraocular movement is normal.
NECK:  There is no lymphadenopathy in the neck or supraclavicular fossa.
LUNGS:  Showing slightly diminished air movement in the lung.
HEART:  Showing irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation.
LYMPHATICS:  There is no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
RECTAL:  Deferred.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Reveals hearing impairment bilaterally.  Otherwise, unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  An 80-year-old male with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung, 1.8 
cm in size in the left lower lobe, status post wedge resection and 2 cycles of carboplatin and 
etoposide.  Restaging workup study shows no evidence of disease by CT of the chest and MRI 
of the brain on April 13, 2021.  He is now referred to Radiation Oncology for consideration of 
prophylactic cranial irradiation.

PLAN AND RECOMMENDATION:  Ideally, I would like to offer hippocampus-sparing whole 
brain irradiation to 25 Gy, 2.5 Gy per fraction.  However, this option could not be accepted by 
insurance company.  Also, prophylactic cranial irradiation indication may be weak because of 
only 1.8 cm lung nodule of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  I would like to leave this issue to 
Dr. Iheagwara.  Also, they will discuss in his family regarding prophylactic cranial irradiation.

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with contralateral lung 
involvement, adenocarcinoma type, KRAS mutation positive, diagnosed on a preoperative chest 
x-ray in December 2013.  Progression of disease noted in November 2014.  At that time, repeat 
biopsy showed adenocarcinoma and KRAS mutation was negative. 
  
PRIOR THERAPY:  Please refer to the note from February 2015, for complete details.  Previous 
treatments included carboplatin, Taxol, and Avastin, last in May 2014.  She received 
maintenance Avastin until November 2014 when she was noted to have progression of disease.  
New brain lesions were noted in December 2015 in the work up of neurologic symptoms.  She 
received SRS to 5 lesions in January 2016.  
  
CURRENT THERAPY:   
1. Alimta 500 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks.  Her last dose was on January 20th with Dr. Dai at 
Uniontown Cancer Center. 
2.  SRS to new frontal lobe metastasis; on hold until performance status improves.   
3. Decadron taper.
 
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Ms. Grooms returns to clinic for further management of the above.  
Unfortunately, she presented to the hospital in December 2015 with new brain lesions.  These 
lesions were treated with SRS in January 2016.  However, she developed new neurologic 
symptoms including left-sided weakness and was admitted to the hospital again at the end of 
January.  At that time, she was found to have severe vasogenic edema due to her recent SRS 
treatments as well as a new left frontal lobe metastasis that has yet to be treated due to 
declining performance status.  While inpatient, she was also noted to have a right upper lobe 
pneumonia, which was subsequently treated with IV antibiotics.  She was discharged initially to 
the TCU and has now been discharged to a skilled nursing facility where she has been 
continuing  rehab on a daily basis.  The patient states she continues to have a good outlook but 
her left sided weakness continues to be significant.  She is working with PT and OT multiple 
times a day, but is not yet able to walk on her own.  She requires assistance of 2-3 people to get 
to the bathroom as well as with minimal daily activities.  She denies any fevers, chills or sweats.  
She denies any change in appetite or weight loss.  She denies any nausea, vomiting, or 
hematemesis.  She denies any bright red blood per rectum or any melena.  She does have 
some shortness of breath with exertion, but overall states this is stable.  She denies any cough 
or hemoptysis.  She denies any headaches, change in vision, or focal weaknesses.  She denies 
any new bone pain or back pain.  She does note some irritation to her skin underneath her 
abdomen, at the nursing home, she is using powder on this area to help prevent skin 
breakdown.  She denies any numbness or tingling in her extremities.  She does note continued 
weakness along her left side, especially in her left lower extremity. 
  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the interval history, otherwise all systems have been reviewed 
and are negative. 
  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
GENERAL:  This is an elderly female in no apparent distress. 
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 97.9, pulse 76, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 122/72, pulse 
ox 98% on room air.  She is unable to be weighed. 
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular 
movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae are pink. 
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable adenopathy noted. 
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes. 
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs. 
ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds are present.  Soft, nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly. 
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis or clubbing.  She has some trace edema in the left lower 
extremity, which is soft.  Pulses are 2+ throughout. 
NEUROLOGIC:  She is alert and oriented.  She has left-sided weakness.  The left upper 
extremity strength is 4/5, left lower extremity strength is 3/5.  Right-sided strength extremity, 
both upper and lower is 5/5.  Sensation is intact throughout.
SKIN: Grossly intact.  She has some areas of excoriation under the abdomen. 
  
LABORATORY DATA:  From today shows a white blood cell count 10.6, hemoglobin 9.4, 
hematocrit 27.7, platelets 109,000, ANC 8700.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.5, BUN 32, creatinine 
0.6, calcium 8.9, magnesium 1.8. 
  
RADIOLOGIC DATA:  She had a CT of the chest and abdomen completed today, February 25, 
2016.  CT shows the mass in the right upper lobe, the left upper lobe nodule and the superior 
segment left lower lobe mass are all unchanged in size when compared to scans from 
December 2015.  There is a new peripheral nodule measuring 2.8 cm with central cavitation 
related to her recent pneumonia, which is resolving.  All lymph nodes are less than 1 cm and 
short axis diameter and there is no evidence of any new metastases in the abdomen or skeletal 
system. 
  
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 
1.  Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, KRAS mutation positive.  
Unfortunately, Ms. Grooms' recent performance status has recently declined due to the 
progression of disease in the brain.  She had significant vasogenic edema related to the recent 
stereotactic radiosurgery treatments causing a continued decline in performance.  Last dose of 
maintenance Alimta was on January 20th.  CT scans from today, which Dr. Petro and I 
personally reviewed, show stable disease.  The posterior right upper lobe mass, left lower lobe 
mass and left upper lobe nodule are all stable in size.  She has a new right upper lobe nodule 
which is cavitary; likely related to her resolving pneumonia.  We would like to repeat CT scans in 
3 months.  We recommend to hold any further maintenance Alimta until performance status 
improves.  She does need treatment to the new left frontal lobe lesion that was noted on MRI 
during recent hospital admission.  Radiation oncology is waiting until neurologic symptoms 
improve before continuing with further radiation. We have encouraged continued PT and OT on 
a daily basis to help improve her strength and performance status.  She will continue to follow 
very closely with Dr. Dai.  
2.  Right upper lobe pneumonia.  This looks to be resolving on CT scans today.  She does not 
have any current infectious symptoms and white blood cell count is normal.   
3.  Left-sided weakness secondary to vasogenic edema. This will hopefully improve with 
continued PT and OT.  She has continued to dexamethasone for vasogenic edema.  She was 
given weaning parameters today.  She will return to our clinic in 4 weeks to ensure continued 
improvement. 
END OF DICTATED REPORT BY CRNP.  ATTENDING MD COMMENT BELOW. 
  
I have personally spoken with the patient, reviewed today's CRNP's progress note for this 
patient and agree with the findings as documented.  Today the key element(s) of service that I 
personally provided are as follows:  CT scans today revealed stable disease.  Resolving 
pneumonia in RLL.  I personally reviewed these scans.  Hold chemo and SRS to new left fronts 
lesion until PS improves.  Continue Decahedron taper.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old white male who has a known 
diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in the right upper lobe with left adrenal 
metastasis since July 2014.  He received first cycle of chemotherapy with Taxol and carboplatin 
in August 2014.  He was hospitalized at UPMC Shadyside for 10 days because of pneumonia 
and dehydration.  He also developed renal insufficiency.  He had an aortic valve replacement in 
the past.  He received new chemotherapy with Taxotere.  Initially, he had a very good response.  
Repeat CT scan in March 2015 showed increasing size of tumor.  He was started on nivolumab 
(Opdivo) in March 2015.  He had a very good response, but he has stable disease now.  His 
recent CT scan in March 2016, showed possible progression and he was seen by Dr. Socinski 
for a second opinion.  He reviewed CT scan and patient has stable disease.  The patient follows 
with Nephrology and is being considered for hemodialysis.  The patient has hypothyroidism 
secondary to Opdivo.  He takes Synthroid.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient does have some fatigue and generalized weakness.  He 
denies any dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, angina, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or 
melena.  His edema to his lower extremities has gotten significantly worse.  He had an AV 
fistula placed 1 week ago to his right arm.  He is seeing his nephrologist tomorrow for possible 
dialysis.  he had  Dermatology remove skin lesions to his back.  The rest of his 10-point review 
of systems is negative.

PATIENT ID#:        000007989

DATE OF VISIT:      02/23/2016

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Mr. Shumar is a very pleasant 72-year-old gentleman presenting for 
ongoing treatment and evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  He originally was diagnosed in 2005, at which point in time, he was 
found to have a right upper lobe lesion, which was confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma of 
the lung for which he underwent resection under the direction of Dr. Matthew Schuchert.

He was followed and found to have a lingular lesion also consistent with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the lung and underwent ablation and PDT in 2009.  He was found to have a 
squamous cell carcinoma of the proximal esophagus and received chemoradiotherapy again in 
2009 under the direction of Dr. Sajid Peracha.

He was followed with surveillance imaging and had a CT scan in September 2014 revealing an 
enlarging left lower lobe mass, which was subsequently biopsied and significant for an 
adenocarcinoma with an underlying KRAS mutation.  The patient therefore received SBRT in 
November 2014 under the direction of Dr. Karlovits. 

He underwent radiographic surveillance at which point, a PET scan in August 2015 
demonstrated a new 3.9 cm soft tissue mass in the perivascular space as well as a new ill-
defined left lower lobe mass measuring 6 cm and bone metastasis. It was at that point in time 
that I met him and had recommended systemic therapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel.

He underwent carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel under the direction of Dr. Peracha and completed 
this in December 2015, and has been on a course of clinical and radiographic surveillance.  At 
the conclusion of treatment, he was noted to have stable disease.

INTERIM HISTORY:  Mr. Shumar returned to the office today for interim followup.  Since I last 
saw him, he had received systemic therapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel under the 
direction of Dr. Peracha.  Unfortunately, he did not tolerate therapy very well and felt 
progressively fatigued throughout the chemotherapy.  The chemotherapy concluded in 
December and his interim history since that point in time has been notable for a persistent 
decrease in his overall energy level.  He has actually moved in with his sister since the last time 
I saw him, and his day-to-day activities with regard to his baseline level of activity are quite 
limited.  He spends most of his time sitting in a chair, dozing off.  He has some progressive 
shortness of breath.  He has no lightheadedness or dizziness.  He has no abdominal pain.  He 
is chronically constipated for which he takes laxatives.  His appetite is poor and he continues to 
lose weight.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His comprehensive review of systems was reviewed, is as noted and 
otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature of 97.9.  His blood pressure is 100/64, pulse rate 75, respirations 
18, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is a Caucasian male, elderly, and thin, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  He has no pharyngeal lesions.
LYMPHATICS:  He has no palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, nondistended, soft with no hepatosplenomegaly and no palpable 
masses.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  He is alert and appropriate without gross motor abnormalities.
SKIN:  Reveals no ecchymosis or breakdown.
PSYCHIATRIC:  Reveals appropriate mood and affect.  

LABORATORY DATA:  Performed yesterday and are notable in ARIA. His creatinine is at his 
baseline at 2.1.  His calcium is 8.5.  His white count is 3.7, hemoglobin 8.9 and platelet count of 
207.  He has new radiographic data in the form of a PET/CT, which was performed on February 
2, 2016, which I did personally review, it did demonstrate a left paramediastinal and left upper 
lobe lesion, which was generally stable with extensive right lower lobe bronchiectasis and 
mucus plugging.  In addition, there was note of a new FDG avid right adrenal metastasis and 
some progression of the FDG-avid skeletal metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Shumar is a very pleasant 72-year-old gentleman presenting 
for ongoing treatment and evaluation for non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell histology, 
who comes to the clinic today for repeat evaluation, having recently completed systemic therapy 
with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel in December 2015.  He benefited from stable disease with 
regard to systemic therapy.  However, unfortunately, he has continued to have issues with 
regard to his treatment-related side effects with persistent fatigue.  In addition to that, he has 
notable interim restaging, which does show some small increase in his burden of disease, 
specifically with regard to new adrenal metastasis.  I had an extensive discussion with Mr. 
Shumar today with regard to his treatment options going forward, I think at face value, he could 
potentially be a candidate for immunotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab given his 
underlying histology and treatment history.  That being said, I did discuss with them that while 
these agents are generally associated with better toxicity profiles than single agent 
chemotherapy, they are not entirely benign and are associated with  side effects, which could 
potentially be detrimental to him and the benefit is not necessarily guaranteed. They are in 
understanding of this.  I think at this point in time in discussing with him his performance status 
is clearly a 3 and I think the benefit with regard to pursuing systemic therapy in patients with 
such performance status is questionable at best.  As such, I discussed with them the role of 
best supportive care, which is something that he has thought about in passing, but has not 
thought about extensively.  His sister on the other hand has thought about this extensively, I 
have discussed with him the role of best supportive care and addressing the symptoms related 
to cancer without pursuing active cancer treatment with the goal of quality of life over 
prolongation of life and I also discussed the role involving hospice, especially if his burden of 
disease related symptoms progress. He would like some time to think about this.  He also has 
an appointment with Dr. Schuchert  next week and then the week following with Dr. Peracha.  I 
have told him that we will continue to be available to him should any questions arise.  I will be in 
touch with Dr. Peracha and Dr. Schuchert with regard to the discussion we had today.  Should 
any issues arise, Mr. Shumar was encouraged to call.  Otherwise, he will follow up as needed.

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  This is a 62-year-old gentleman with stage IV non-small cell lung 
cancer, adenocarcinoma histology with underlying KRAS mutation with CNS involvement, status 
post craniotomy followed by radiation, currently on systemic chemotherapy. 
  
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Initially presented with symptoms of headaches and mild 
nausea, referred to UPMC at Passavant on October 29th with a CT scan showing 3 intracranial 
lesions, the largest was 3.3 cm with 9 mm midline shift.  The patient immediately was 
transferred to UPMC Presbyterian and underwent craniotomy on November 3rd for the right 
parietal, right cerebellar and left cerebellar tumor followed by gamma knife to the tumor bed.  
The patient subsequently had a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showing 1 
retroperitoneal periaortic lymph node as well as multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest of 
which was 9 mm.  The pathology was TTF-1 positive, favoring adenocarcinoma of the lung.  
The molecular studies were KRAS mutant. 
  
CURRENT THERAPY:  Carboplatin and pemetrexed, presenting today for cycle 3. 
  
INTERVAL HISTORY:  Richard returns to our clinic and is presenting today for cycle 3 of 
carboplatin and pemetrexed for his stage IV lung cancer.  The patient is having mild effects from 
treatment including fatigue and nausea for the first couple of days.  He states that it is tolerable 
and he takes the antinausea medications with relief.  He denies any diarrhea or constipation.  
His breathing is stable.  He denies any chest pain or musculoskeletal discomfort.  No 
neurological issues.  Appetite has been fair and energy level is adequate. No fever or chills. 
Recently had two teeth pulled without any complications or residual pain. 
  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Complete review of systems noted, otherwise negative. 
  
MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed. 
  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 130/80, respiratory rate 16, pulse 68, temperature 97.7, and 
weight 147 pounds. 
HEENT:  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclerae are 
anicteric. poor dentition. 
CARDIAC:  S1, S2 noted. 
LUNGS:  Clear. 
ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds present. 
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. 
NEUROLOGIC:  No focal deficit. 
  
LABORATORY DATA:  WBC is 8.7, hemoglobin 14, platelets 163,000.  Creatinine 1.6, 
potassium 4.1, sodium 139, bilirubin 0.4, ALT is 18, AST is 16, alkaline phosphatase is 83. 
  
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 62-year-old gentleman with a significant past medical 
history of a 40-year-old pack smoking history with a recent diagnosis of stage IVB non-small cell 
lung cancer, adenocarcinoma histology with KRAS mutant in the form of central nervous system 
disease, status post craniotomy and radiation to the surgical bed on November 5, 2015, and is 
currently on systemic chemotherapy, status post 2 cycles.  The patient had restaging CT scans 
recently revealing stable disease as well as an MRI of the brain showing response to radiation 
treatments.  His treatment was delayed due to 2 teeth extractions without any complications.  
The patient denies any significant adverse effects except mild fatigue and nausea, which is 
controlled.  His laboratories are adequate today and he will proceed with treatment.  He will 
follow up in 3 weeks for cycle 4 of carboplatin and pemetrexed.  In the interim, if he has any 
problems or issues, he was encouraged to contact our office. 
  
END OF DICTATED REPORT BY PA-C.  ATTENDING MD COMMENT BELOW. 
  
I have personally spoken with the patient, reviewed today's PA-C's progress note for this patient 
and agree with the findings as documented.  Today the key element(s) of service that I 
personally provided are as follows : 
  
Patient is a 62 yo gentleman w/o a significant PMH and 40 pk/yr smoking history with recent dx 
of Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung (KRAS mutant) with CNS involvement s/p craniotomy 
and radiation to the surgical bed s/p two cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed. The patient's first 
cycle was complicated by arthralgia which resolved with steroids. His restaging scans 
demonstrated stable disease. Of note, patient has had dental infection for which we have 
started him on Augmentin and therapy was delayed two weeks until his tooth was pulled. His 
infection is now resolved and we will proceed with C3 today. The patient will return in 3 weeks 
for C4 or sooner if there are any issues..

                                   CONSULTATION

 
REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Daniel Petro, MD.

DIAGNOSIS:  Non-small cell lung carcinoma with subpectoral metastasis.

ICD-10:  C77.3.

STAGE:  Recurrent.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  We were asked to evaluate this 68-year-old female for the 
potential role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of her metastatic non-small cell 
lung carcinoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Dantico is a 68-year-old female with a past medical 
history significant for a non-small cell lung carcinoma.  She was originally presented in April 
2015 with a right-sided neck mass.  Biopsy was found to be consistent with that of an 
adenocarcinoma of the lung, was TTF-1 positive.  She was initially started on a systemic 
therapy under the direction of Dr. Daniel Petro consisting of a combination regimen of 
carboplatin, Taxol and Avastin.  She has had further progression and was treated with 
immunotherapy and more recently Alimta.  She has been tolerating Alimta well which she has 
continued in terms of prior radiation.  She has had stereotactic radiosurgery to a neck 
metastasis on the right side, which she received a total dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions as part of 
UPCI protocol 10-028.  She has had a complete response in this region.  She is continued on 
Alimta and is doing well.  Clinically, she did have her recent interval PET/CT scan, which 
demonstrates stable disease within the neck and a new development of a subpectoral lymph 
node.  We are asked again to address the potential role of stereotactic radiosurgery to this 
lesion.

SURGERIES:  Mammoplasty, appendectomy, hip replacement, knee replacement, neck biopsy.

ILLNESSES:  Non-small cell lung carcinoma, depression, osteopenia, and anxiety.

MEDICATIONS:  Alimta, candesartan, Compazine, alprazolam, venlafaxine, Synthroid, and 
Tylenol.

ALLERGIES:  DILAUDID, TOLECTIN.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory to the current illness.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has a past history of nicotine dependence, no longer smoking.  No 
alcohol use, no recreational drug use.  She is accompanied today by her husband.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for fevers or chills.  No headaches or vision change.  No 
neurological symptoms.  No dysphagia, odynophagia.  No neck symptoms.  No appreciated 
lymphadenopathy.  No cough, shortness of breath.  No chest pain, palpitations.  No nausea, 
vomiting or diarrhea.  No urinary complaints.  Remainder of review of systems is negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 224, blood pressure is 126/80, pulse of 94, no reported pain, fatigue of 
6/10.  KPS is 90.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
LYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
NECK:  No axillary lymph nodes.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema.

IMAGING:  PET/CT scan was reviewed, which demonstrates on the right side a subpectoral 
lymph node.  There are no other apparent sites of disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Dantico is a 68-year-old female with a past medical history 
significant for metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma with histology favoring that of an 
adenocarcinoma.  She originally presented with metastatic disease approximately 1 year ago, 
and has been managed primarily with systemic therapy.  We did deliver a short course of 
radiation therapy to a right-sided neck node which she tolerated quite well and had a complete 
response within this region.  She has continued on Alimta since that time with a more recent 
restaging PET/CT scan.  This PET/CT scan demonstrated an increasing right-sided subpectoral 
node as her only site of oligometastatic disease.  Today, we discussed the potential role of 
stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of her disease.

The role of stereotactic radiosurgery was reviewed including the risks, benefits and alternatives 
to treatment.  Based upon the location of this lesion, it is amenable to stereotactic radiosurgery 
versus that of surgical resection.  Given that she has tolerated Alimta well we would like for her 
to continue systemic therapy without interruption and therefore her stereotactic radiosurgery is a 
reasonable alternative.  We reviewed the risks, benefits and alternatives including the potential 
for irritation in and around the brachial plexus as well as the skin and adjacent ribs.  She did 
provide us with informed consent for treatment.  We will schedule her for a 5 fraction regimen 
which will be delivered on nonconsecutive days and this will be coordinated in and around her 
receiving continued Alimta.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

diagnosis of stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with malignant pleural effusion.  EGFR and 
ALK, mutation were negative.  He initially received chemotherapy with carboplatin, Alimta, and 
Avastin.  He had an excellent response.  PET/CT scan in July 2013 showed complete 
remission.  CEA came down to 0.8.  He received maintenance treatment with Avastin alone.  
His CEA level went up to 8.8.  Repeat CT scan in January 2014 showed small pleural effusion.  
We restarted chemotherapy with carboplatin, Alimta, and Avastin in February 2014.  He 
developed skin rash, but it was not related to his chemotherapy.  His CEA came down to 1.8.  
He received maintenance treatment with Alimta and Avastin without carboplatin every 4 weeks.  
His CEA level continued to rise again.  In March 2016, CEA level was 5.3.  CT scan in February 
2016 showed no significant change.  Sometimes, CT scans change is proceeded by abnormal 
blood test.  The patient does not want to receive full dose of chemotherapy because of side 
effects.  He was started on new immunotherapies with nivolumab.  He does not have any 
significant side effect.  His CEA level came down to 4.4.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any fever, chills or night sweats.  Appetite is good.  
He has some GERD symptoms and was restarted on Protonix.  Denies any nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematuria, or any other bleeding.  The rest of his 10-point 
review of systems is negative.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 69-year-old white male who has a known diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the 
lung in the right upper lobe with left adrenal metastasis since July 2014.  He received first cycle 
of chemotherapy with Taxol and carboplatin in August 2014.  He was hospitalized at UPMC 
Shadyside for 10 days because of pneumonia and dehydration.  He also developed renal 
insufficiency.  He had an aortic valve replacement in the past.  He received new chemotherapy 
with Taxotere.  Initially, he had a very good response.  Repeat CT scan on March 2015 showed 
increasing size of tumor.  He was started on nivolumab (Opdivo) in March 2015.  He had a very 
good response, but he has stable disease now.  Recent CT scan in March 2016, showed 
possible progression and he was seen by Dr. Socinski for second opinion.  He reviewed CT 
scan and the patient has stable disease.  The patient follows with Nephrology and was started 
on hemodialysis one month ago.  The patient has hypothyroidism secondary to Opdivo.  He 
takes Synthroid.  His July 2016, CT scan shows progression.  He is here today to start 
necitumumab/Gemzar day 1 and day 8 on an every 21 day cycle.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complains of fatigue and generalized weakness.  He has 
lost 20 pounds of water weight since starting dialysis.  The rest of 10 point review of system is

DATE OF VISIT:      09/16/2016

                             CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE

DIAGNOSIS:  A 71-year-old here for followup after prior palliative whole brain and right lung 
radiation therapy for stage IV, T1b N2 M1b adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe of the lung 
with adjacent hilar, paratracheal and mediastinal involvement, also with 14 bilateral brain 
metastases, status post 30 Gy whole brain radiation therapy, completed on November 20, 2014, 
followed by 30 Gy right lung and mediastinum radiation therapy, completed on December 31, 
2014, after which the patient started systemic therapy.
 
FOLLOWUP SCHEDULE AND RECENT STUDIES:  The patient returns 6 months after his 
most recent followup visit with me here on February 12, 2016, when he had recent progression 
at the primary site and just changed systemic therapy to Opdivo.  Just before I saw him the 
patient had had a brain MRI on January 7, 2016, which showed excellent response to prior 
whole brain radiation therapy.  Previous metastases had decreased to 2-3 mm, at most, 
enhancing foci, suggesting the possibility of residual disease, but no definite residual.  
Subsequent brain MRI was done on April 21, 2016, and was stable to even smaller with less 
than 2 mm enhancing foci for some sites and many sites no longer visualized as abnormal or 
enhancing.  The patient continues Opdivo therapy with stable disease and good tolerance to 
treatment as of the last restaging scans on June 23, 2016.  However, yesterday he had 
restaging scans at Jameson, including a CT of the chest, showing increase in size of the 
suprahilar density consistent with possible malignancy from 3.1 cm to 4.1 cm, ""neoplasm is 
likely.""  There were prior postoperative and prior post-radiation changes, which are stable 
around the trachea and subcarinal region and slight increase in prior left axillary 
lymphadenopathy from 2.1 to 3.2 cm, compared to June 23, 2016.  I reviewed the images from 
this scan and from the prior scan in June and agree the perihilar enhancing density is larger, as 
is the left axillary lymphadenopathy, now relatively bulky with 2 adjacent nodes abutting and 
possibly matted to each other.  This pair of nodes abuts the left axillary vein nerves and arteries.  
The patient is here today with his wife, Audreen. 
 
SUBJECTIVE:  He is feeling ""pretty good, except my joints.""  He refers to the right hip, the right 
knee and the left knee, both shoulders; he says, ""That must be from the Opdivo"".  His wife says 
""his cough has changed"".  He had surgery for small-bowel obstruction in May.  He was in 
Intensive Care for 17 days with pneumonia subsequent to the surgery.  He says he is starting to 
develop a cough that was similar to the cough when he had the  pneumonia.  I explained that 
the CT report does not show any definite pneumonia, although the density described in the right 
hilar and mediastinal region, which has increased in size was described as ""none of this mass 
appears to enhance and while pneumonia is possible, neoplasm is a primary consideration.""  I 
reviewed the images with the patient and his wife including current scan, scans from June 23 
and scan from April 21 before he got pneumonia and the mass in question in the right 
hilar/mediastinal region was present in April, unchanged from June, so I doubt this is 
pneumonia, certainly not the same post-surgical pneumonia he developed in May.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
SYSTEMIC:  Denies dyspnea, denies DOE, denies fatigue, sweats, fevers, or chills.
WEIGHT LOSS:  None.
GENITOURINARY:  None.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  None.
BONE PAIN:  As noted above, the patient has arthritis.
OTHER PAIN:  None.
BLEEDING (GU/GI/resp/gyn):  None.
DERMATOLOGIC:  Negative.
VISUAL:  Negative.
HEARING:  Negative.
PULMONARY:  As noted, the patient has a recent cough reoccurring even after the pneumonia.
CARDIAC:   Negative.
PSYCHOLOGICAL:  Negative.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Negative.
  
MEDICATIONS:  Opdivo, coenzyme Q10, Colace, Coreg, Crestor.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Chaperone present during the exam is the patient's wife, Audreen.
Overall condition excellent and the patient is in no apparent acute distress.  Weight: 155 lbs, 
T=97.2, P=79, Resp=18, BP=128/73, KPS=90, Pain=0/10.
Psychologically the patient appears to have appropriate affect and is without obvious emotional 
distress.
MENTAL STATUS:  The patient is oriented x 3 and is appropriately engaged in the discussion 
and appears competent to make medical decisions.
HEENT:  Oropharynx and oral cavity are without masses.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II-XII are intact.
NODES:  No nodes are palpated in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  The known left 
axillary lymphadenopathy is not palpable on today's exam.
LUNGS:  Left lung is surgically absent and there are no breath sounds on the left side.  On the 
right, there are no wheezes appreciated, lung is clear and there is mildly prolonged expiratory 
phase of breathing.
HEART:  RRR, no murmur or ectopy are noted.
ABDOMEN:  No masses, hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness are noted.
SPINE:  Nontender to percussion.
SKIN:  No lesions are noted.
 
IMPRESSION:  Results of yesterday's restaging scan as described above with some evidence 
of progression, in my opinion, particularly in the left axillary region but also in the right 
hilar/mediastinal mass, which appears to be residual after prior palliative radiation therapy to 
that site and other intrathoracic and intracranial sites.  The enlarging left axillary 
lymphadenopathy is neither palpable or symptomatic.  Excellent response to prior whole brain 
radiation therapy with last brain MRI in April essentially negative for residual definitely active 
metastases.
 
PLAN:  Return in 6 months.  I have ordered a repeat brain MRI at this time, with and without 
contrast, at Jameson or Lawrence County Imaging, using brain mets protocol.  This will be done 
in the next couple of weeks and I will contact the patient by telephone when the results are 
provided to me.

 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 69-year-old white male who has a 
known diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in the right upper lobe with a left 
adrenal metastasis since July 2014.  He received the initial chemotherapy with Taxol and 
carboplatin in August 2014.  He was hospitalized at UPMC Shadyside for 10 days because 
of pneumonia and dehydration.  He also developed renal insufficiency.  He had an aortic 
valve replacement in the past.  He received new chemotherapy with Taxotere.  Initially, he 
had a very good response.  Repeat CT scan in March 2015 showed increasing size of the 
tumor.  He received nivolumab (Opdivo) in March 2015.  He had a very good response.  
Repeat CT scan in March 2016 showed possible progression.  He was seen by Dr. Socinski 
for a second opinion.  He reviewed the CT scan and the patient had a stable disease.  In the 
meantime, he required hemodialysis because of severe renal failure.  He developed 
hypothyroidism secondary to Opdivo.  He takes Synthroid.  Repeat CT scan in July 2016, 
showed progression of disease.  We started new treatment with necitumumab and Gemzar, 
day 1 and day 8 every 21 day cycle.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any shortness of breath.  He denies any fever or chills.  
The rest of 10-point review of systems is negative.

                                    OFFICE NOTE

 REASON FOR VISIT:  Followup of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In April 2014, the patient developed hematuria.  Workup 
revealed a kidney stone, but also a right lung nodule.  Further testing in May 2014 revealed a 
3.5 x 5.1 x 5 cm mediastinal mass as well as a 1.4 cm right upper lobe mass and a 1.9 cm right 
lower lobe mass.  Biopsy confirmed EGFR negative adenocarcinoma.  PET scan confirmed 
uptake in the primary tumor, left femur and adrenal gland.  Brain MRI was negative.  She was 
treated with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin through October 2014, with a PET scan at the 
conclusion of therapy, revealing significant improvement.  She refused Xgeva therapy.  She 
then received maintenance Avastin through July 2015, at that time, scans found new 
adenopathy in the right hilum and central mediastinum with near occlusion of the SVC.  She 
received concurrent radiation and chemotherapy in July 2015 followed by retreatment with 
Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin through November 2015.  At that time, scans revealed a new 
lung nodule concerning for disease and subsequently, she was treated with Alimta, carboplatin, 
and Avastin through February 2016.  Scans at that time revealed significant improvement and 
she started maintenance Avastin in March 2016.  Followup scans have been stable.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Ms. Kelly comes in today for followup and to continue her Avastin.  
She tells me since her last visit, she has been doing well.  At her last visit, she was given a low-
dose of Lasix to be taken as needed for her leg swelling and tells me this has definitely helped.  
She denies any fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting.  She denies any bleeding from the nose, 
gums or bowels.  She denies chest pain, shortness of breath or cough.  She denies headaches, 
dizzy spells or fainting spells.  She denies any new bone or joint pain.  Her appetite is good.  All 
other systems were reviewed with the patient and are negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished white female in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 95.0, heart rate 74, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 138/87, 
weight 137 pounds, which is up 2.6 pounds.
HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  No 
scleral icterus.  Oropharynx is moist and pink without tonsillar erythema or exudate.  There is no 
thrush and there are no mouth ulcers.
NECK:  No JVD or thyromegaly.
NODES:  No anterior cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy palpable.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or 
masses.
EXTREMITIES:  No cords or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.
SKIN:  No rash or petechiae.
LABORATORY DATA/IMAGING:  CBC today is unremarkable.  Chemistry panel at that time 
was also unremarkable.  Urinalysis reveals no protein.

ASSESSMENT:  A 75-year-old white female with metastatic lung cancer.  She is currently on 
maintenance Avastin therapy.  She is tolerating this well and her scans over the past several 
months have revealed stable disease.

PLAN:  Ms. Kelly will receive her Avastin today.  She will come back in 3 weeks for treatment.  I 
will see her back in 7 weeks.  We will scan her prior to that visit and if everything continues to 
look stable, we will keep her on the Avastin.  If she has any problems prior to her next visit, she 
can call my office.

maintenance Avastin therapy.  She is tolerating this well and her scans over the past several 
months have revealed stable disease.

PLAN:  Ms. Kelly will receive her Avastin today.  She will come back in 3 weeks for treatment.  I 
will see her back in 7 weeks.  We will scan her prior to that visit and if everything continues to 
look stable, we will keep her on the Avastin.  If she has any problems prior to her next visit, she 
can call my office.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Mary Radziukinas is an 81-year-old female presenting for ongoing 
treatment of her recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, status post concurrent 
chemoradiation therapy as of December 29, 2015 and currently on observation. 
  
PRIOR ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  As per note from January 28, 2016, was notable for initial T1 
lesion in the left lower lobe, status post resection in 2013 with Dr. Schuchert followed by 
recurrence, status post chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel and definitive concurrent 
chemoradiation therapy on December 29, 2015. 
  
INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient returns to our clinic for further evaluation and was last seen 
on February 25, 2016.  The patient since then denies any new complaints.  No recent illnesses 
or hospitalizations.  Her energy level is adequate and she continues to volunteer.  Appetite is 
good and weight has been consistent.  No nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea.  
Breathing is stable.  She denies any neurological symptoms. 
  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Complete review of systems noted, otherwise negative. 
  
MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed. 
  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 129/70, respiratory rate 16, pulse 78, temperature 97.1, weight 
151 pounds.  ECOG is 1. 
GENERAL:  Elderly female, appears to be stated age, in no apparent distress. 
HEENT:  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclerae 
anicteric. 
NECK:  Supple.  No adenopathy. 
LYMPHATICS:  No palpable lymphadenopathy. 
LUNGS:  Clear. 
CARDIAC:  Normal rate and rhythm.  No rubs, murmurs or gallops. 
ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds present. 
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. 
NEUROLOGIC:  No focal deficits. 
PSYCHIATRIC:  Appropriate mood and affect. 
  
LABORATORY DATA:  WBC is 4.4, hemoglobin 14, platelets 190,000.  Creatinine 0.9, 
potassium 4.8, sodium 143, ALT is 13, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 65.  Calcium is 9.4. 
  
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mary is an 81-year-old female with a history of left-sided squamous 
cell carcinoma, status post resection in 2013.  The patient had a biopsy-proven recurrence with 
mediastinal adenopathy as well as a questionable metastatic contralateral lung nodule, status 
post systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel, being treated with likely stage 
IIIA disease with possibility of stage IV, given the contralateral nodules, which were not PET 
avid.  The patient proceeded with 2 cycles of chemotherapy with therapeutic response and 
improvement in the mediastinal adenopathy as well resolution of the contralateral lung nodule.  
The patient subsequently underwent definitive chemoradiation therapy with weekly carboplatin 
and paclitaxel, completed on December 29, 2015, complicated with radiation esophagitis and 
weakness.  Since then, the patient's symptoms have recovered and she is doing quite well.  She 
had a CT scan in the interim on April 4, 2016, which showed stable disease.  The patient denies 
any disease related symptoms and she is asymptomatic.  The patient from our standpoint is 
scheduled to undergo a CT scan with Dr. Schuchert in July and we will follow up at that time as 
well.  In the interim, if she has any problems or issues, she was encouraged to contact our 
office.

 Nancy Cerovich is a pleasant lady with history of melanoma and lung cancer.  She returns 
today for followup.  She denies any other complaints, denies any other major issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
CONSTITUTIONAL:  Negative.
CARDIAC:  Negative.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  No issues.
GENITOURINARY:  Negative.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Negative.
NEUROLOGIC:  Negative.
HEMATOLOGIC:  No easy bruisability.  No bleeding diathesis.
LYMPHATICS:  Negative.
Reminder of the review of systems negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Not in any distress, looks well.
HEENT:  PERRLA.  Normal oral cavity.
NECK:  No JVD.  No lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  S1, S2 heard.  No rubs.  No murmur.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation, equal air entry.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.  No tenderness, no distension.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.  Pulses felt.

LABORATORY DATA:  Reviewed and they are essentially within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Nancy Cerovich is a pleasant lady with
1.  Malignant melanoma with metastatic disease to the lymph node and she is currently on 
treatment with Opdivo.  She is doing very well and the lymph node is no longer evident and she 
is in remission with regard to the melanoma.
2.  She did have lung cancer and we did do stereotactic radiation and she was in remission and 
most recent PET scan shows that she is in remission.  Continue with observation.
3.  She does have a new lesion in her anterior mediastinum and it is pretty FDG avid, and I 
would recommend getting another CAT scan and if it shows any progression, I will probably look 
into the biopsy and even if it is stable disease, possibly we should look into getting a biopsy.

DATE OF VISIT:      01/24/2017

                                    OFFICE NOTE

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  David Strelec is a 67-year-old gentleman with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the lung with an underlying KRAS mutation.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: He was initially diagnosed in March 2015 and was treated at that point 
in time with a right lower lobectomy and right upper lobe wedge resection with adjuvant 
pembrolizumab for 12 doses as part of a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Unfortunately, he was subsequently found to have progression of disease and was treated in 
the first line setting with carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab, status post 4 cycles of 
therapy.

ALLERGIES: 1. CODEINE CAUSING SKIN RASH AND HIVES.

MEDICATIONS: 1. AndroGel pump. 2. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. 3. Liothyronine 25 
mcg daily. 4. Nadolol 40 mg daily. 5. Tirosint 125 mcg daily. 6. Tums daily.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. pT2a N0 non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed 
February 12, 2014. 2. Testicular cancer, status post orchiectomy, RPLND and chemotherapy in 
1984. 3. Osteoarthritis. 4. Hypothyroidism. 5. Hypertension. 6. Left total hip replacement. 7. Left 
total knee replacement. 8. Orchiectomy. 9. Right lower lobectomy. 10. Thyroidectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's parents are both deceased. Father deceased at age 84 from 
complications of congestive heart failure. Mother deceased age 84 from seemingly natural 
causes. The patient has one sister, age 59 who is in good health.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single, but engaged to be married. He has a 17-pack-year 
history of smoking and quit over 30 years ago. He consumes on average 1 alcoholic beverage 
per day.

INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient is presenting to our clinic for continued treatment with 
maintenance pemetrexed every 4 weeks.  The patient reports that he is otherwise doing well 
and is able to tolerate his functional daily activities.  The patient is looking forward to his trip to 
Panama, which will delay his treatment by 1-3 weeks.  He reports he is up-to-date with his 
vaccinations.  The patient reports he has no new symptoms and overtly denies any fever, night 
sweats, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
dysuria, bleeding, rash, weakness, numbness, tingling, blurry vision or headache.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per interval history.  Otherwise complete 14-point review of 
systems is largely unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 292 pounds, temperature 98.1, heart rate 67, respiratory rate 16, blood 
pressure 160s/90s and saturating 96% on room air.
GENERAL:  A well-appearing male, in no apparent distress.

HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes.  No oropharyngeal lesions.  Sclerae are anicteric.

NECK:  Supple.  No adenopathy.

LYMPHATICS:  No supraclavicular, cervical, axillary or thoracic adenopathy appreciated.

CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal rate and regular rhythm.  No murmurs.

ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender and nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.

EXTREMITIES:  No edema, erythema or tenderness.

NEUROLOGIC:  No focal deficits.

PSYCHIATRIC:  Cooperative and pleasant.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.9, hemoglobin 10.5, platelets 256 and creatinine 1.1.  
Electrolytes are otherwise unremarkable.

RADIOGRAPHIC DATA:  Last CT scan in October 25th, 2016, which showed stable disease.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. David Strelec is a 67-year-old gentleman with history of 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung with an underlying KRAS mutation, who is status post 
carboplatin, pemetrexed and Avastin for 4 cycles and has been on maintenance pemetrexed 
since.

The patient presents for maintenance pemetrexed every 4 weeks and he continues to tolerate 
his therapy well.  His labs and symptoms are all reassuring to continue with treatment today.  It 
is reassuring that he is functionally doing well and largely asymptomatic.  The patient is slightly 
hypertensive he has been because of the steroids and continues on his antihypertensive 
medications that reassuringly he is largely asymptomatic.  The patient's last set of scans have 
been unremarkable.  He wishes to delay his treatment till after he comes back from Panama 
along with his scans.  The patient will leave for Panama in 1-2 weeks and then return in 5 weeks 
and then would like to come back to clinic in 6 weeks for further treatment with pemetrexed as 
well as CT scans at that time.  

We will schedule his appointment as well as his CT scans for when he returns back from 
Panama around March.  We will continue with this treatment plan given how well he is tolerating 
it.  As an aside, he is going to have a tooth extraction in a couple days and we reassured him 
this should not be an issue.  The patient's and family members' questions were answered to 
their satisfaction and they have the clinic information and will call in the interim with any new 
symptoms or developments.  The patient and family members conveyed understanding 
regarding the risks and benefits of further workup and management as well as the plan set forth 
and they are amenable to continuing.

multiple bilateral resolving hematomas in the setting of metastatic disease.ii.  No new lesions 
suspicious for metastatic disease.
2.  CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast, February 17 2017, compared to 
CT/PET from November 3, 2016 and biopsy chest CT October 19, 2016.  Multiple bilateral 
nodules, both solid and nonsolid.  One of the nodules in the superior segment of the left lower 
lobe measures smaller than on previous CT scan November 3, 2016.  The other nodules are not 
significantly changed in size, density or appearance.  No new pulmonary nodules.  CT 
evaluation of the lungs is otherwise negative and there are no enlarged intrathoracic lymph 
nodes.  No findings of visceral metastasis or adenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis.  There is a 
new 2.3 cm sclerotic lesion in the left aspect L2 vertebral body, which corresponds to previous 
site of FDG avidity without a discrete lesion on prior CT portion of PET/CT.  This new sclerotic 
focus on the current study may reflect treatment effect.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1.  Ms. Chetoka is a 54-year-old female with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma presenting with lung 
masses, upper abdominal adenopathy and brain metastasis, final pathology positive for PD-L1 
at 90% and KRAS mutation.  She started pembrolizumab on December 15, 2016 and has had 3 
cycles of therapy thus far.  Restaging CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis are essentially 
stable.  Therefore, she will continue current therapy, cycle 4 pembrolizumab today and return for 
next office visit and treatment in 3 weeks.
2.  Brain metastasis.  She had restaging MRI of the brain last week with stable findings.  She 
saw her neurosurgeon this morning and has instructions to taper off dexamethasone and repeat 
MRI of the brain in 3 months.
3.  Weakness.  She is given an order for physical therapy twice a week. 
4.  Anxiety.  She is already on Wellbutrin, Zoloft and Xanax, so we will defer to her primary care 
physician.
